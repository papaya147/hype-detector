The Taiwanese company shared an informal note with the government after reports suggested it is not hiring married women. The company said that such stipulations are not part of its policy and these claims may have been made by those disgruntled individuals who were not hired, sources said. They added that such media reports malign the fast-growing Indian manufacturing sector. \"Foxconn had clarified that 25 percent of the latest hires are married women. This would mean nearly one-third of the total women are married. This ratio compares favourably to any factory in this sector currently operating in India,\" one of the sources said. The Foxconn factory currently has about 70 percent women and 30 percent men and the Tamil Nadu plant is the largest factory for women employment in the country with the total employment having touched 45,000 workers during peak periods, they said. The company has also informed that the discussion around Hindu married women being discriminated against for wearing metals (ornaments and jewelry) is \"entirely slanted\" and wearing metal in such factories is a safety issue, a fact well recognised by both the industry and the government. \"Any person wearing metals - man or woman - regardless of their status (single or married) and their religion (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh etc.) are required to remove metals while working in the factory,\" the source said quoting the company's informal note. For safety reasons, no one wearing metal is allowed to work on the shop floor and this is a prevalent practice in several industries. According to sources, the company has stated that the media report is based on anecdotal comments by 5-10 people or potential job seekers. These comments likely came from candidates who did not get the job or no longer work at Foxconn. No immediate comments were received from Foxconn in response to an email query sent to the company on the matter.
