The Indian government is the largest minority shareholder in Hindustan Zinc, owning a 29.54% stake, but was not consulted by the company when it decided to split the firm to create separate entities for its zinc, lead, silver and recycling business, the government source said requesting anonymity.

The government's mines ministry, finance ministry and Hindustan Zinc did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
