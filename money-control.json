    "content": "After losing the manufacturing plants of Bengaluru-based EV firms Ola and Ather to neighbouring Tamil Nadu, Karnataka is now charting plans to woo companies to set up operations in the state. Speaking at the Moneycontrol Startup Conclave in Bengaluru last week, IT-BT Minister Priyank Kharge said, “The government is engaging more with companies, corporates, and industries. We learn from them and see how we can make our policies sharper than the rest. We provide them with land, subsidised power tariffs, water, etc. We are creating an entire ecosystem in terms of education, research and development, innovation, policy, and skills.” Responding to a query on how Karnataka is losing EV manufacturing plants to neighbouring states, IT-BT Secretary Ekroop Caur said, “I'm confident that with the new policies and the government's focus on creating industrial townships around Bengaluru, which are in high demand by tech-oriented industries requiring high-end skills, we will be able to attract these companies back to Karnataka.” The state government has been planning industrial townships in Ramanagara, Tumakuru, Mandya, Kolar, Chikkaballapur and Chitradurga districts. “Under the revised Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) policy, we are supporting certain aspects of automotive technology. We are also coming up with a new clean energy policy, in which the automotive sector will play a major role. I believe it will be so attractive that no one will be able to overlook Karnataka. Another major advantage is that, with all the R\u0026D happening in Karnataka, there is enormous potential.” Caur said.

We started by focusing on our education system. If you look at our education landscape, we have around 234 engineering colleges, close to 70 medical colleges, and 44 universities. We have around 1,770 public and private industrial training institutions. We also have prestigious institutions like the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). Karnataka produces the highest number of graduates for the workforce\". \"We did not become the world's fourth-largest technology cluster overnight. We transitioned from being primarily a back-office operations hub to providing IT-enabled services, and now we are extremely strong in research and development, which has led to innovations and inventions. Karnataka is ranked number one in the India Innovation Index and has consistently held this position, making us the leading state in innovation in the country.” said Kharge.

    "content": "Pirojsha Godrej, executive chairman of Godrej Properties - the real estate arm of Godrej Group, said the next chapter will involve the company aiming higher and making big strides to become a leader in India's business landscape. \"I think the next chapter will involve us upping our ambition and recognising that there's nothing stopping us from making these individual businesses become some of the leading businesses in the country,\" Godrej said in an interview with The Economic Times. Godrej thinks that the Godrej brand is a tremendous asset that's been built up over 127 years. He said it gives them the immediate credibility and ability to play in a variety of sectors. \"But if I was to be a little self-critical of the group's performance over the years, I'd say that given the kind of brand we have, the kind of opportunities there are in India today, and the kind of talent we're able to attract to the group, have we done full justice to, you know, building some of India's individual, largest businesses. You know, where is the TCS kind of company in the Godrej group?\" He said that brand sharing took the most time during the talks. \"Because it's quite complicated in a large group that's been around for as long as we have to determine how exactly the brand sharing would happen,\" he said.  Properties, chemicals, agrovet, new financial services business and real estate businesses were always being managed by Godrej and that continues. Land was always being managed by Godrej and Boyce and will always be owned by them, he added. Speaking about disagreements over brand usage, Godrej said  there's freedom for each side to operate the brand in their categories. \"There is a high degree of trust and confidence the family has in each other, that both sides are looking out for the good of the brand and for the long-term value creation of the businesses.\" He then said there will be opportunities for discussion if there are situations where one side feels that something better could be done or that something's negatively impacting the brand. \"I think there's a high degree of confidence that everyone's reasonable and has the same end-goal in mind on this, which is maximising the value of the brand,\" he added.",

The bank’s wealth management unit is “old” and it wants to change its approach to how it tackles this business, according to Chairman Dinesh Khara. To that end, SBI is deploying about 2,000 executives as relationship managers and focusing on ties with smaller companies across the country, Khara said at the bank’s earnings briefing. “We manufacture all the products in the financial sector and have the largest distribution network,” Khara said, in response to a question about whether SBI will consider teaming up with other wealth managers. “We should be in a position to reach out the product to the customers.” He declined to comment on the bank’s current assets under management. SBI, which has more than 22,500 branches in India, is joining global and domestic players flocking to grab a share of managing India’s growing pile of wealth. The country generated about $590 billion in new financial wealth in 2023, its largest increase in history, according to a recent report from the Boston Consulting Group. SBI will face competition from global players like HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays Plc, and local veterans like 360 One WAM Ltd. who are expanding their services and teams to service India’s rich. Private lenders like ICICI Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. have also made inroads into the country’s wealth management sector.",

    "content": "Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has intensified operations to increase gas production in Tripura to feed power generation plants in the northeastern state, an official said on Monday. The decision comes amid reports of a reduction in gas supply to various gas-based power generation plants in the state. ONGC produced 1,527 million standard cubic metres (MMSCM) of gas in Tripura in the 2023-24 fiscal, while it has set a target of extracting 1,675 MMSCM gas in the current fiscal. He said that ONGC will dig as many as 20 new wells for gas exploration in the financial year 2024-25 and one more rig will be added shortly to boost the exploration drive. At present, six rigs are being used by ONGC to explore natural gas in the northeastern state. Besides new exploration, ONGC has also initiated the process of cluster drilling to extract gas using old well sites as existing wells already have facilities and approval for exploration. \"Due to rapid urbanisation in Tripura, ONGC is focusing on cluster drilling to extract gas by using old wells because facilities are already available there. Also, we don't need to get fresh approval from the state for gas exploration or extraction in those sites. There is also no need to acquire land which has become a costly affair,\" he said. Emphasising the issue of proper utilisation of gas, Kumar said if one of the units of the Palatana power plant in the state shuts down for any reason, the gas supply becomes surplus, causing loss to ONGC. \"If gas becomes surplus due to the shutdown of any plant, it becomes a problem because other plants operating in the state do not have the capacity to receive the surplus gas. It causes loss to the ONGC,\" he said. Various state-run agencies operate the gas-based power plants in Tripura.",

    "content": "Passenger vehicle (PV) retail sales in India witnessed a 10 percent on-year jump in July driven by new model launches and enhanced discounts. According to Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), the total PV retails rose to 320,129 units in July, as compared to 290,564 units in July 2023. The jump in PV retails come at a time when despatches by carmakers to dealers went down by 2.5 percent at 344,076 units last month vis-à-vis 352,941 units in July 2023. On a month-on-month (MoM) basis, PV retails shot up by nearly 14 percent from 281,566 units in June 2024. \"Dealers reported benefits from good product availability, attractive schemes, and a wider range of products. Nonetheless, heavy rains, low consumer sentiment, and intense competition posed challenges. Some dealers managed to sustain sales through strong promotions and incremental discounts, stated FADA vice president CS Vigneshwar In his view, \"This poses a substantial risk for dealer sustainability, necessitating extreme caution. FADA urges PV original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to be vigilant about potential dealer failures due to these high inventory levels.\" It was reported recently that auto dealers, which has been saddled with a huge inventory pileup, have urged carmakers to delay vehicle dispatches. The auto retail body reiterated that high inventory levels pose a significant risk and it is crucial for PV OEMs to avoid further increases in stock to prevent financial strain on dealers. “It is also crucial for the Reserve Bank of India to mandate financial institutions to implement stringent checks before releasing inventory funding, preferably requiring dealer consent or collaterals to prevent the escalation of NPAs, he added. Two-wheeler and CV segments also grow Two-wheeler retail sales last month stood at 14.43 lakh units, an increase of 17 per cent over 12.31 lakh units in July 2023. According to FADA, the segment experienced notable growth due to a thriving rural economy, positive monsoon effects, and the government's support programmes enhancing rural incomes. \"The introduction of new products and better stock availability also contributed significantly, despite market slowdowns in certain regions, excessive rains, and increased competition,\" he added. Commercial vehicle (CV) retail sales grew 7 percent year-on-year to 80,057 units last month. \"Positive factors included growth in the construction and mining sectors, while challenges such as continuous rainfall, negative rural market sentiment, poor finance availability, and high vehicle prices were also noted,\" Vigneshwar said, adding that tractor sales declined 12 percent year-on-year to 79,970 units in July. FADA, which collated vehicle registration data from 1,568 out of 1,645 RTOs across the country, noted that the near-term outlook across the auto retail segments shows a blend of optimism and caution. It expects the two-wheeler sales to be buoyed by factors such as a growing rural economy, positive monsoon impacts and the introduction of new products. The festive season beginning after the Aadi festival and favourable agricultural conditions are also likely to contribute to increased sales, according to FADA However, heavy rainfall, ongoing agricultural activities and inconsistent monsoon patterns may dampen demand in certain areas. FADA noted that the PV segment could see mixed results in the near-term. While the festive season, attractive schemes and good monsoon are expected to boost sales, concerns over low consumer sentiment, heavy rainfall and a lack of new product launches persist, FADA noted The CV segment faces a modest outlook, with positive factors including improved market reach and the festive season, tempered by challenges such as bad freight rates and ongoing rainfall, it added.",

    "content": "U.S.-based Glas Trust is asking an Indian court to not quash insolvency proceedings for ed-tech giant Byju's as lenders the trust represents are owed $1 billion, posing a new challenge for the Indian startup that was once the nation's biggest. Byju's was valued at $22 billion in 2022 before being hit with many setbacks including boardroom exits, an auditor resignation and a public spat with foreign investors over mismanagement. The company has denied any wrongdoing. Byju's is facing insolvency proceedings after India's cricket board said it was not paid $19 million in sponsorship dues. Its former billionaire CEO Byju Raveendran wants the insolvency quashed as his co-founder brother decided to pay the cricket board, settling the matter. Byju Raveendran hasn't commented on the matter. But Riju in a separate court filing dated Aug. 1 and seen by Reuters, said he paid the cricket board's settlement amount from \"personal funds\" and the liquidation of personal assets. A judge is likely to rule on the matter on Friday. Raveendran and a spokesperson for Byju's did not respond to a request for comment. Glas Trust also did not respond. Byju's, which operates in more than 21 countries, became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic by offering online education courses. A ruling by the Indian court in favour of Glas could renew problems for the ed-tech company despite the settlement with the cricket body and means its assets would remain frozen. Raveendran has warned that insolvency would lead to \"a total shut down of services\" and could trigger an employee exodus. Byju's has around 27,000 employees, including 16,000 teachers.",

    "content": "Media company Zee Entertainment has raised Rs 2,000 crore in order to have a ready pool of capital to keep pace with the changing dynamics in the broadcast and streaming industries that could result  from the upcoming joint venture between Reliance and Walt Disney. In June 2024, Zee Entertainment's board of directors approved a plan to raise up to Rs 2,000 crore through the issuance of shares or other securities. This approval came after Sony scrapped its $10 billion merger with Zee in January 2024. \"The team is working on the plans to use the funds raised. Those plans will be ready with deployment.

It also added that a major part of the reduction in employee expenses from layoffs has already been attained and no further reduction is expected. There will be a focus on maintaining an optimal employee structure, Zee said. \"There has been emphasis on keeping the morale of employees high following the layoffs by Zee. Most of the key talent is still with Zee,\" the company said. A lot has happened in the last 6 to 8 months but we are working towards maintaining upbeat morale in the company, said Punit Goenka, MD \u0026 CEO, ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. \"We had some churn but a large part of it was on the tech side. These people had become redundant so it (layoffs) happened.\" Goenka added that despite some green shoots in the last quarter of the previous fiscal,  ad revenue growth still remains subdued with the rural economy yet to pick up entirely. \"This quarter was sports heavy coupled with general elections which took the share away from general entertainment. Our conversations with large FMCG clients indicate the pickup in ad spends with the onset of the festive season,\" he said. On the digital front, the company said that for Zee5 the focus is to attain a balanced cost structure. \"Zee5 losses will keep declining going forward, in the medium-to-long term. The focus will remain on growing revenue while keeping a close watch on the costs. The company will be ready to make significant investments to capitalise on emerging opportunities,\" Zee management said. The streaming platform's revenue declined sequentially to Rs 223.7 crore in Q1 from Rs 237.2 crore in Q4 FY24 which was largely led by sports events and elections in the first quarter of FY25, the company's management said adding that the OTT platform is led more by the GEC genre. The company added that the reduction in losses has been led by lower manpower and marketing expenses without lowering the expenditure on content in Zee5. It added that most subscribers of Zee5 are enrolled in the annual plan.",

    "content": "Faced with a growing number of cases of investment fraud, HDFC Bank on Thursday advised its customers to be cautious against fraudulent trading platforms that offer investment opportunities. Most of the lucrative offers come through social media platforms and the aim of this advisory is to increase awareness about potential investment frauds to safeguard customers, HDFC Bank said in a statement. In cases of investment fraud, fraudsters are seen to typically promise unusually high returns on investments in stocks, IPOs, cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, etc, it said. Cautioning on this fraud, HDFC Bank, executive vice president (Credit Intelligence and Control) Manish Agrawal, said, \"We are seeing an increase in the number of cases of investment frauds and want to help create a wider awareness and knowledge about the issue, so that the consumers can avoid falling prey to these deceptive schemes.\" While the government, banks and regulatory bodies are taking steps to curb these frauds, individual vigilance and awareness play a very important role in avoiding falling prey to illegitimate schemes, he said. The statement further said platforms are also seen promoted on social media inviting persons to join these high return investment schemes, which are in fact bogus. Fraudsters typically exploit people through social engineering tactics, however being cautious and transacting only after due diligence, will help safeguard against fraudsters, it added. In the event that a person becomes a victim of any online fraud, it said, they should immediately report the unauthorised transactions to the bank in order to get the payment channel blocked. Customers should also file a complaint by calling 1930 helpline number started by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) as well as submit a complaint on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal.",

    "content": "The tax department may issue notices to other infotech players as well, news agency Reuters reported citing a government source, amid scrutiny of alleged service tax evasion by their overseas offices, a day after Infosys faced the tax demand. \"This is an industry-wide issue,\" a senior tax official familiar with the developments told Reuters, implying notices may be sent to other IT companies too. India's second-largest IT company Infosys was slapped with a tax demand for alleged evasion of over Rs 32,000 crore from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), as per a document seen by Moneycontrol. The document said Infosys was including expenses incurred towards overseas branches as part of their export invoice and computing the eligible refund based on that. \"Issuing such a substantial show-cause notice is likely to set a precedent, leading to similar notices being issued to other multinational companies, particularly in the IT sector,\" Rajat Mohan, director at accounting firm MOORE Singhi told Reuters. Infosys clarified that it has paid all dues and GST is not applicable on expenses claimed by DGGI. \"Infosys has paid all its GST dues and is fully in compliance with the central and state regulations on this matter,\" the company said in a statement. Former Infosys board member and Chief Financial Officer Mohandas Pai called the Rs 32,000 crore GST demand as 'tax terrorism' at its worst. \"This is a business model issue, not a tax evasion issue,\" he added. Shares of Infosys have been subdued in trade on August 1, weighed down by the tax demand.",

    "content": "A suspended director of the troubled Indian educational tech firm Byju’s must pay $10,000 a day until he helps locate $533 million that his company is accused of hiding from US lenders, a judge said Wednesday. Riju Ravindran, brother of Byju’s founder, has been at the center of a nearly two-year-old fight over the missing cash, which lenders say should be returned to them after the company defaulted. Ravindran is one of three directors of Think \u0026 Learn Pvt. — which operates the Byju’s brand — who were recently replaced by a trustee as part of an involuntary bankruptcy case filed in India, according to US court documents. After imposing the sanctions on Ravindran, US Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon also rejected a request to put the US debt fight on hold so Ravindran and the company could find new lawyers. American lawyers for Ravindran and Byju’s units want to quit defending their clients in the bankruptcy dispute, blaming “an irreparable breakdown.” The moves are the latest twists to an usual saga involving a company that was once a symbol of India’s rising technology sector. Within 18 months of borrowing $1.2 billion from US lenders in 2022, Byju’s missed key financial reporting deadlines, had their offices raided by Indian regulators and was accused by American lenders of defaulting. Since then, the company has been accused of fraudulently transferring $533 million away from a shell company set up in the US that was responsible for paying the debt. Byju’s has defended its actions by claiming it has been targeted by predatory lenders. The missing money is at the heart of a dispute between lenders owed $1.2 billion and the startup founded by entrepreneur Byju Raveendran. The missing cash belongs to a bankrupt shell company, Byju’s Alpha Inc., which is affiliated with Think \u0026 Learn and was taken over by the lenders after their loan defaulted. The US bankruptcy case is BYJU’s Alpha Inc., 24-10140, US Bankruptcy Court District of Delaware (Wilmington).",

    "content": "India’s Akasa Air plans to add destinations across Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent to tap the booming demand for overseas air travel in the world’s most-populous nation. The Mumbai-based budget carrier is gearing up to start flights to Kathmandu in Nepal and Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, Praveen Iyer, chief commercial officer at Akasa’s parent SNV Aviation Pvt, said in an interview. Other travel hotspots such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia are also on the airline’s radar, he said. “Indians in general love traveling. That prompts us to look at the next set of expansion,” Iyer said. Outbound traffic from India starting October is “very strong” with Southeast Asian destinations emerging as big contributors, he said. Akasa is also preparing for intensifying competition as its local rivals bulk up: Tata Group-owned Air India and Vistara are merging while market leader IndiGo plans to fly long-haul international routes. Meanwhile, at least a half-dozen overseas carriers such as Etihad Airways and Malaysia Airlines have added or introduced flights to Indian cities. The carrier ordered 150 Boeing 737 Max jets in January, pushing its total order book to 226 jets, due to be delivered over the next eight years. Akasa aims to expand its short-haul international network using its narrowbody fleet that is capable of flying routes of up to six hours. It began overseas operations in March with services to Doha from Mumbai and has added more Gulf destinations including Abu Dhabi and Jeddah. Pets on BoardClosely held Akasa has already eked out a 4.7% share so far this year in the highly competitive Indian market, which has seen multiple carriers go bust in recent years. IndiGo controls 61% of the market while Air India had 14.2%, according to data from India’s aviation regulator. With a fleet of 24 jets flying 49 routes, Akasa has narrowed in on niche offerings such as allowing pets on board. It has carried 3,700 pets since implementing the policy in Nov. 2022.  Akasa does not plan to raise funds and is “well capitalized,” Iyer said, declining to provide additional details or the carrier’s path to profitability. Akasa Air’s expansion comes as India’s aviation industry becomes increasingly consolidated, and its larger rivals try to introduce new products to entice customers. Under Tata’s ownership, erstwhile state-owned Air India will fold in Vistara, while low-cost unit Air India Express will combine with AIX Connect. IndiGo is expected to unveil a new premium cabin soon. Both IndiGo and Air India have placed record aircraft orders with aircraft manufacturers. “We will always be around two 800-pound gorillas, right? One is the Tata group and the other is IndiGo. That’s the reality,” said Iyer. “How we build our network is what matters to us.”",

    "description": "A number of high-profile companies have underwhelmed investors, including McDonald's, automakers Nissan and Tesla, and consumer giants Nestle and Diageo.Global companies have zeroed in on two issues hitting their bottom lines: higher interest rates that are pinching consumer spending, and underperformance in China's economy, the second-largest in the world.Related stories",
    "content": "Companies worldwide are lowering full-year sales and profit guidance as higher interest rates and weakness in China's economy hurt global consumer sentiment, taking the shine off earnings growth in the latest quarter. A number of high-profile companies have underwhelmed investors, including McDonald's, automakers Nissan and Tesla, and consumer giants Nestle and Diageo. With roughly 40 percent of US and European companies reporting results, earnings have come in about as expected - but after the strong run by world equity markets, 'about as expected' seems like a disappointment. \"A very mixed season so far in terms of results,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \"We're starting to see the pressure that the higher-for-longer interest rate environment is putting on companies and their ability to continue to drive earnings and revenue growth.\" Global companies have zeroed in on two issues hitting their bottom lines: higher interest rates that are pinching consumer spending, and underperformance in China's economy, the second-largest in the world.McDonald's reported its first drop in sales worldwide in 13 quarters, citing weakness in China's economy. Companies including Unilever, Visa and Aston Martin also noted weakness in China, and analysts have warned that demand in the Asian giant is unlikely to reverse while a protracted property downturn and job insecurity weigh on consumers. \"The Chinese... are not willing to spend because they are afraid about the future,\" said Stefan-Guenter Bauknecht, portfolio manager at DWS. Until growth improves in China, the country will be \"the weakest of the big regions, or at least the most far behind expectation,\" he said.Earnings per share have so far risen by nearly 12% in the United States from a year ago, the strongest quarter out of the last 10, according to LSEG data. Earnings are up 4% in Europe, according to Bank of America Securities, slightly ahead of market expectations and for Europe the first positive growth rate since 2022. Consumer weakness is being flagged across industry sectors and guidance cuts have picked up, the brokerage said. US companies have reduced third-quarter forecasts to 7.3% year-over-year growth as of Friday from 8.6% at the beginning of July, according to LSEG data. \"While Q2 results overall have been decent, the season has nonetheless spooked the market on signs of consumer stress,\" Bank of America analysts said in an research note. Nestle, opens new tab and Unilever, opens new tab both reported first-half sales growth below expectations. Companies in the euro zone's two largest economies are growing more pessimistic, raising concerns over the bloc's sluggish recovery. \"There is value-seeking behavior among consumers. There is pressure, especially at the low-income range,\" Nestle CEO Mark Schneider said on a call with journalists. Auto companies are facing difficulties in the United States, where high inventories and logistical issues hurt profits of Ford Motor, Stellantis, and Nissan, EV leader Tesla, disappointed investors with its results, and many still see the company as far overvalued with EV sales slowing. EV battery firm LG Energy Solution, which supplies Tesla and Hyundai Motor, forecast revenue would fall more than 20% this year due to a sharper-than-expected slowdown in global EV demand. Its bigger rival, China's, reported a 13% drop in second-quarter revenue. CASHING IN CHIPS The earnings news has hardly been all bad. Google parent Alphabet's growth in cloud computing revenue augurs well for other tech bellwethers later this week. Industrial conglomerate 3M's results sent its shares to near a two-year high, while automaker General Motors and pharmaceutical giant Johnson \u0026 Johnson posted strong earnings, and banking giant JP Morgan said its profit hit a record. Asian chipmakers have turned more bullish about demand outlook as they benefit from the global AI boom that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led electronics demand. \"AI is so hot; right now everybody, all my customers, want to put AI functionality into their devices,” TSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei said at an earnings conference, adding AI demand now is more real than two or three years ago. Shares of TSMC have gained 56% so far in 2024. Despite upbeat forecasts, shares of major Asian chipmakers are under pressure to keep up with rising expectations. That's evident as well in the performance of AI leader Nvidia, whose value surged past $3 trillion earlier this year before pulling back in the summer. “Investor expectations are so high they may be hard to meet, and in the short term, the stock price may not rise as much,\" said analyst Lee Min-hee at BNK Investment \u0026 Securities. The broad-market MSCI International index has gained 11% so far this year, peaking earlier this month before selling off, in part due to hopes that the US Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates after similar moves from other central banks. \"To the extent that lower rates ahead remains the popular view, analysts are unlikely to be lowering overall earnings projections for next year,\" Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments.",

    "description": "The clash of titans is likely to intensify as the deep-pocketed tycoons seek to dominate supplies of a building material that is critical to sustaining India’s infrastructure boom. Billionaire battle heats up as Adani challenges Birla in cementRelated stories",
    "content": "Battle lines are being drawn in India’s cement space as Gautam Adani’s expansion spree sets off a race with fellow billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s UltraTech Cement Ltd. to build capacity and snap up assets. The clash of titans is likely to intensify as the deep-pocketed tycoons seek to dominate supplies of a building material that is critical to sustaining India’s infrastructure boom. Adani’s ambitious upstart and the sector leader UltraTech have already done six deals in less than two years, with Birla’s cement maker announcing the seventh on Sunday to control a coveted regional player. At least half a dozen smaller rivals are still up for grabs. Adani Group’s big bang entry in 2022 upended the local pecking order — it became No. 2 cement maker overnight with the acquisition of Ambuja Cements Ltd. and ACC Ltd. — but it spent much of 2023 fire-fighting after Hindenburg Research’s scathing report. The ports-to-power conglomerate only got back to its expansionist ways fully this year, stoking a turf war in cement as Birla’s entrenched incumbent digs in its heels. M\u0026A WarchestAdani, already down four acquisitions in the sector since it entered, is looking to double annual production capacity to 140 million tons by 2028. The group is scouting for more cement assets to expand its reach, procure key raw material — limestone reserves — and has a war chest of about $4.5 billion for acquisitions over the next two years, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Adani Group, which controls India’s largest private sector port operator, is aiming to drive down costs significantly even if it can’t match the cost efficiency of Chinese cement makers, one person said. Sea or inland water transportation costs a fraction of transport via trucks and Adani Ports \u0026 Special Economic Zone Ltd.’s network will be helpful there, this person added. Adani Ports is already planning a 2-million-ton cement grinding unit at its transshipment terminal in Kerala. Green energy from group firms can help pare fuel costs, the person said. Leadership Moat To bolster the moat around its leadership, UltraTech acquired a smaller rival last year. In June, it bought a minority stake in a Chennai-based cement maker in June before ramping it up to majority control this week —  a move seen as marking its territory to fend off Adani. It’s also circling another target. Birla’s cement giant will continue to expand operations and snap up assets to reach 200 million tons annual capacity by 2027, people familiar with Birla’s strategy said. Representatives for the Adani Group declined to comment while those for UltraTech didn’t respond to an emailed request for comments. Mission to BuildPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s mission to build everything from airport and power facilities to roads, bridges and tunnels will spur India’s infrastructure investment to 15 trillion rupees ($179.2 billion) by March 2026, according to Crisil Ratings. This will spawn massive demand for cement, outpacing supply in the coming years and creating opportunities for expansion that neither Adani, Asia’s second-richest person, nor Birla can resist. Adani, which acquired Penna Cement Industries Ltd. last month, has looked at Jaypee Group’s as well as Orient Cement Ltd. in the recent past, according to local media reports. Orient Cement has now drawn interest from UltraTech also. Others such as Saurashtra Cement Ltd., Mangalam Cement Ltd., Vadraj Cement Ltd. and Bagalkot Cement Industries Ltd. may also emerge as targets, people familiar said.  The southern parts of India is the most fragmented market for cement in the country, with the highest installed capacity and a large number of firms which have not expanded capacity over the years, Sanjeev Kumar Singh and Mudit Agarwal, analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. wrote in a July report. “It is possible that a few of these entities might consider exiting the industry if they are offered favorable valuations,” Singh and Agarwal wrote. Hunting GroundThat makes this geography the perfect hunting ground for both the billionaires, who have already begun cliching deals. Adani’s Penna Cement purchase in June was to boost its footprint in southern India. Days later, UltraTech bought a 23% stake in India Cements Ltd., a Chennai-based firm with almost 14.5 million tons capacity, in a move to block any possible Adani overtures. On Sunday, Birla’s firm bought almost a third more of India Cements for $472 million, pushing its total stake past 55%. It “enables UltraTech to serve the southern markets more effectively” and expedites the path to 200 million tons target, Birla said in a statement Sunday. “The pace of acquisitions in the cement industry was inevitable because of government spending in infrastructure and housing,”said Aveek Mitra, New Delhi-based founder of Aveksat Investment Advisory. India has about 100 listed and closely held cement makers, with most having tiny market shares, according to Mitra. “Asset block of 28 million tons is in pipeline for acquisition” and M\u0026A deals will continue since the large incumbent players want to maintain their market share, Anupama Reddy, co-group head of corporate ratings at ICRA Ltd. wrote in a June 13 note.  To be sure, even with all the aggressive expansion it’d still be hard for Adani to topple UltraTech. The gap between the two rivals is significant and will remain so, based on announced capacity additions. Anti-Trust ScrutinyAdani and UltraTech will also need to be mindful of scrutiny from India’s anti-trust watchdog and avoid acquisitions in geographies where they have high market share concentration. While cement demand is strong now, it could reduce in four or five years, according to Jyoti Gupta, a research analyst at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. Smaller players like Dalmia Bharat Ltd., Shree Cement Ltd. and JSW Cement Ltd. are also scaling up. “When infrastructure spending will reduce, and there is ample supply of residential properties, will there be enough demand to utilize all this added capacity?” Gupta said.",

    "content": "SoftBank-backed Indian e-scooter maker Ola Electric's IPO is set to draw investor bids from Fidelity, Nomura and Norway's Norges Bank, as well as several Indian mutual funds, two sources with direct knowledge told Reuters. Ola Electric's roughly $740 million IPO will open this week and will be the first by an Indian electric vehicle maker. The company is the biggest player in the e-scooter market in a country where adoption of clean vehicles is still low but rising rapidly. Fidelity will place bids of around $75 million while Nomura and Norges will bid $100 million each in Ola's so-called IPO anchor book, where high-profile institutional investors are allotted shares before the subscription opens for other investors, said the first source with direct knowledge of the bid amounts. Ola Electric did not respond to a request for comment. None of the investors named above immediately responded on Sunday outside regular business hours. Ola's IPO, one of biggest in India this year, will see the company issue new shares to raise $660 million and also see its existing investors, including founder Bhavish Aggarwal, offload their stake of about $80 million to IPO investors. Quota for anchor investors in the IPO is about $330 million, the first source said. Sources had earlier said the IPO is expected to value the company at around $4.2-4.4 billion, but the sources on Sunday said the final valuation is lower at around $4 billion to $4.2 billion. That valuation is about 22% to 26% lower than in Ola's last funding round in September, which was led by Singapore's investment firm Temasek and valued the country's largest e-scooter maker at $5.4 billion. The lower valuation for the IPO is because of a correction in valuation of global tech companies globally and as Ola wants to ensure high participation in the stock offering, sources have said. The IPO comes amid heightened capital markets activity in India, where stock markets are trading near a record high.",

    "content": "Paytm has got approval from the government for its 500 million rupees ($5.97 million) investment in a key subsidiary, a top finance ministry official told Reuters on Friday. The approval, which was stuck for months due to the company's link to China, will remove the main stumbling block to the unit, Paytm Payment Services, resuming normal business operations. Following the approval, shares of One97 Communications, the parent company of Paytm, surged 10 percent and was locked in the upper circuit at Rs 509.05 on the NSE. This also marks the first time since February 8 that shares of Paytm surpassed the Rs 500-level. Follow our live blog for all the updates Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the government had given the investment the green light. Vivek Joshi, financial services secretary, said the company can approach India's central bank to seek a payment aggregator license which the bank will evaluate. Shares of the payments aggregator have been under pressure since February following the RBI's action against its Payments Bank. In January, the shares had reached levels as high as Rs 800, however, since then, the stock has been unable to bounceback to that mark. In the June quarter, Paytm's revenue dropped by 36 percent year-over-year to Rs 1,502 crore due to ongoing challenges from RBI restrictions. The company's net loss also widened sharply to Rs 840 crore in Q1 of FY25, the steepest loss since its listing.

    "content": "Realty major DLF plans to launch nearly 37 million square feet area for sale in the medium term across various cities with revenue potential of Rs 1.04 lakh crore as part of its strategy to encash strong demand for luxury homes. In its latest investor presentation for the April-June quarter, DLF informed about the \"planned launches of Rs 1+ lakh crore (36 million square feet) of new products over the medium term\". Giving the break-up, the company said a 12.8 million square feet area will be launched for sales this fiscal with a revenue potential of Rs 42,000 crore. Out of the total Rs 1,04,500 crore worth projects that it intends to launch in medium term, only Rs 1,000 crore worth is planed from commercial properties and the remaining from the housing segment. These projects, largely residential, will be launched primarily in Delhi, Gurugram, Chandigarh Tri-city, Mumbai and Goa. DLF said in the presentation that it continues to scale up its product offerings and is developing margin-accretive products. The company is tapping multiple geographies but the core market remains Delhi NCR. It intends to enter the Mumbai market this fiscal. On strong housing demand, DLF's sales bookings jumped over three-fold to Rs 6,404 crore during the first quarter of this fiscal as against Rs 2,040 crore in the year-ago period. DLF has given guidance to achieve Rs 17,000 crore worth of sales bookings for the entire 2024-25 financial year as against nearly Rs 15,000 crore in the preceding year. The company's sales bookings in the April-June quarter were driven by its luxury project 'DLF Privana West' at Sector 76/77, Gurugram that saw sales of Rs 5,600 crore. In its super-luxury housing project 'The Camellias' at DLF 5, Gurugram, the company sold 4 units for Rs 251 crore. On Thursday, DLF reported a 23 per cent increase in its consolidated profit to Rs 645.61 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal from Rs 527 crore in the year-ago period. Total income rose to Rs 1,729.82 crore during the April-June period of this fiscal from Rs 1,521.71 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. In a statement on Thursday, DLF said, \"We believe that the residential segment is witnessing a structural upcycle and hence we continue to strengthen our new product pipeline.\" \"We stay committed towards leveraging this positive momentum and have planned a strong launch pipeline of an additional 9 million square feet of new products during the fiscal, across various segments and geographies including Gurugram, Mumbai, Goa and Chandigarh Tri-city,\" the company added. The company said it continues to witness healthy sales momentum and strong growth in collections leading to further improvement in its net cash position.

    "content": "With a consistent GDP growth rate of over 7 per cent, India has emerged as an \"inspiring lighthouse of growth\" amid a turbulent world grappling with geopolitical tensions and climate emergencies, ITC Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Puri said on Friday. It has a \"standout performance\" as the world's fastest-growing major economy, which has not only evoked global respect but also points to its future promise, said Puri while addressing the annual general meeting of the company. He further said analysts project India's per capita GDP is likely to touch the \"inflexion point\" of USD 4,000 by 2030, fuelling larger domestic consumption and driving higher growth. Experts predict that India is likely to contribute 18 per cent to the world's GDP growth in the next 5 years and could even touch 30 per cent between 2035 and 2040, he said. The synergy of India's large market, favourable demographics, rising disposable incomes, technological prowess and vibrant entrepreneurship will continue to power growth in the foreseeable future, he said. According to Puri, a sustained public expenditure in physical, digital, agri and rural infrastructure, combined with sharp execution, is fuelling a virtuous cycle of consumption, investment and employment. \"The rise of aspirational India will also spur consumption-led growth,\" said Puri. Over the role of Indian Enterprise in country's growth, Puri said he deeply believes that companies rooted in India, as economic organs of society, can play a \"vital role\" in partnering with the nation in the promising journey ahead. Over the global economy, Puri said the global economy is passing through a storm of geopolitical tensions, climate emergencies, cost-of-living crises, food and nutrition security concerns, and insufficient livelihood opportunities. \"This is also evident in the decline of global merchandise trade by about 1.2 per cent last year,\" he said. Amidst these adversities, rapid technological advancements, including AI are redefining the future. Puri further said India’s favourable demographics constitute one of its greatest strengths as more than a billion people, comprising nearly 70 per cent of the population, will be of working age by 2030. \"Over the next decade, almost a quarter of the incremental global workforce will be from India,\" he said adding \"This powerhouse of productive human capital is unquestionably a source of unique competitive advantage as well as a formidable driver of consumption.\" The Budget 2024 has also announced multi-dimensional programmes to boost skilling and employment, strengthen MSMEs as well as provide impetus to labour-intensive sectors. \"The ONDC platform set up recently can also lend new wings to micro and small enterprises akin to the UPI’s remarkable impact on financial transactions,\" he said. The agri and rural sector, which engages nearly half of the country’s workforce, can contribute further to livelihood generation through larger value addition, digital acceleration and diversification of on-farm, off-farm and non-farm employment. \"It is indeed encouraging that the recent Budget has sharply addressed several of these areas,\" said Puri.",

The company was reacting to a report by news agency Reuters that Hina Nagarajan, the CEO of United Spirits, which is majority owned by Diageo, has been asked to appear before Delhi Police on July 26 and provide documents related to company sales. \"Such notices from regulatory authorities requesting information are usually addressed to the company head-this is a routine process.

It believed other manufacturers might have gotten the notice as well, the company said. \"You are hereby directed to appear in person or through a company representative ... for joining (the) investigation,\" the Reuters report of July 25 quoted the notice as saying. Nagarajan did not respond to requests for comment, Reuters said. \"We are in the process of sending in an authorised representative, as sought in the notice,\" a company spokesperson told the company. A liquor industry source with direct knowledge of the matter said the Delhi investigation concerned how companies like Diageo India supplied liquor to government agencies, which ran retail shops, and how those agencies sometimes offered early payments to suppliers who offered discounts, the report said. The police is investigating whether there was any wrongdoing in this process and has called the CEO as a witness, the source told Reuters. The police notice asked Nagarajan to explain \"whether the discount given to the corporations (government agencies) was in accordance with excise policy\", Reuters reported said. Euromonitor estimates Diageo, the world's biggest spirits maker which sells the Johnnie Walker scotch whisky, is also India's largest with a 19 percent market share by volume in the $35 billion market. The July 4 police notice also sought invoice details from United Spirits in respect of sales and payments received from Delhi city agencies during April 2017 and March 2020, and the name of the company employee who collected payments, it said.

    "content": "Bajaj Auto Ltd., India’s No. 1 maker of auto rickshaws, said it’s received around 6,000 orders for its new compressed natural gas-powered motorbike — a vehicle it bills as a world first — as consumers seek more affordable ways to embrace greener passenger transport. Bajaj Freedom, a sports motorcycle with a 124 cubic capacity engine, was launched earlier this month with a starting price of 95,000 rupees ($1,135). Some 100 of the bikes have already been delivered to customers, Executive Director Rakesh Sharma said in an interview. Sharma puts the addressable audience for the Freedom in the hundreds of millions. Most of Bajaj’s typical customers are price conscious, earning less than 40,000 rupees a month, and the Freedom can shave up to 1,800 rupees off fuel costs versus similarly sized bikes that run on petrol or diesel, he said. Being lead and sulfur free, CNG-run vehicles can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and they’re also quieter than gasoline or diesel ones, which results in less noise pollution. While high levels of domestic production mean CNG in India is cheaper, its lower energy density can require vehicles to refuel more frequently. India’s petroleum and gas ministry has said it aims to build 17,500 CNG filling stations across the country by 2030. Pune-based Bajaj’s Freedom motorcycle was initially launched in states with a high penetration of CNG filling stations, such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and the metropolitan area around capital Delhi, Sharma said. It’s now open for orders across the country. Bajaj also plans to launch the bike in countries that commonly use CNG as an alternative fuel too, like Argentina, Venezuela, Nigeria and Tanzania, Sharma said, without specifying any timeline. Although Bajaj is India’s top maker of auto rickshaws it isn’t No. 1 in scooters. There, it places fourth, with a market share of around 12% behind Hero Motocorp Ltd., Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt.and TVS Motor Company Ltd.. “We’ve heard other competitors are also looking at developing CNG two wheelers,” Sharma said. “It’s a defining movement for the motorcycle industry.”",

    "content": "German luxury carmaker BMW on Wednesday said incentives are necessary to support the growth of the electric vehicle segment. The company, which on Wednesday introduced the all-electric MINI Countryman and electric scooter CE04 in the country, said the market here is still evolving and efforts should continue to smoothen and accelerate this transition. In a press conference here, BMW Group Senior Vice President, Region Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa Jean-Philippe Parain stated that the \"strongest incentives from the state should be for EVs\". Parain noted that in some countries, where customers drive longer distances, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) can be a bridge. \"But if I were to speak for India, I would focus on the full transition to full electric vehicles\", he added. In India the total tax incidence on hybrid vehicles in the country is 43 per cent, which is inclusive of GST, while battery electric vehicles attract a tax of about 5 per cent. Parain stated that there is potential for EVs in India and the company is looking to drive in more products into the country. He noted that besides battery electric vehicles, the automaker is also investing in internal combustion engine models, plug-in hybrids and also thinking about hydrogen vehicles. The company plans to remain flexible when it comes to technologies, Parain stated. Globally, he said that BMW is among the top sellers of EVs along with Tesla and BYD. He noted that the company's sales were impacted in China. \"India is an exception and there is a need to sustain this growth going forward,\" Parain stated. BMW Group India President and Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pawah stated that EVs were suitable for India. Penetration of electric vehicles in India is encouraging and once products are available across all price points, the segment will grow very fast, he noted. Pahwa also noted that the automaker, besides introducing new models, is also investing in establishing charging infrastructure to aid the growth of the segment. BMW on Wednesday introduced the all-new 5 Series Long Wheelbase in the country with price starting at Rs 72.9 lakh. The company also introduced the new Mini Cooper S and the new all-electric MINI Countryman priced at Rs 44.9 lakh and Rs 54.9 lakh respectively. BMW Motorrad introduced premium electric scooter CE 04 at Rs 14.9 lakh.",

    "content": "Mayne Pharma has filed a lawsuit against India's Sun Pharma over infringements of patents related to a certain product used for menopause-related vaginal pain, the Australian drugmaker said on Thursday. In the lawsuit filed at the United States District Court for New Jersey, Mayne Pharma accused its rival of violating all 20 Orange Book-listed patents linked to IMVEXXY - a vaginal insert aimed at reducing pain during sexual intercourse after menopause. Orange Book-listed patents are those approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and deemed safe to use. The ANDA is a request filed to the health regulator for approval of an already licensed drug to manufacture the medication in the United States. These application processes do not warrant the applicant to go through a clinical trial. Sun Pharma did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment. Mayne Pharma's complaint also indicated that Sun Pharma filed a Paragraph IV certification, suggesting the latter challenged the patent's (IMVEXXY) listing in the Orange Book as invalid or inapplicable. This \"formally initiates the litigation process under the Hatch-Waxman Act and triggers a 30-month stay of any potential FDA approval for Sun Pharma's ANDA,\" Mayne Pharma said in a statement.",

India’s largest privately owned refiner plans to start purchasing Venezuelan crude soon, said the people, who asked not to be named as the information is not public. Reliance accounted for around 90% of India’s crude imports from Venezuela after the sanctions were lifted last year, according to data intelligence firm Kpler.  Washington temporarily removed restrictions on the South American nation’s gold and oil sectors last year, when President Nicolas Maduro and the opposition signed a deal to guarantee free and fair elections. The sanctions were then reinstated in April after Venezuela failed to honor the agreement, and oil companies have been applying for permits from the US Treasury Department to keep doing business there. Venezuela’s crude exports climbed to 654,000 barrels a day in June, the highest since April 2020, according to shipping reports and data from Kpler, after the US granted a specific license for companies to continue to drill in the country despite the sanctions being in place. Apart from Reliance, India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp.’s overseas investment arm ONGC Videsh Ltd. has also applied for waivers to import crude from Venezuela.

    "content": "The Indian steel industry is in talks with the federal government for trade measures to combat rising imports particularly from China and Vietnam, JSW Steel Chief Executive Jayant Acharya told Reuters on Tuesday. India turned net steel importer in the fiscal year that ended in March and the trend continues with its finished steel imports scaling a five-year high in April and May, according to provisional government data. \"Indian steel industry is in discussion with the government. I think there are measures which we would be requesting the government to take up,\" Acharya said, without elaborating on the possible measures being discussed. EXPORTS, COKING COAL This year, JSW Steel expects its exports to be 10-15% of total sales, Acharya said, adding that international markets were \"muted\" as of now, while demand in India was \"extremely strong\". Separately, Acharya denied the company was in talks with Australian miner Whitehaven Coal for a stake in its Blackwater metallurgical coal mine. Whitehaven in January said it was exploring a potential sell-down of about 20% of Blackwater to global steel producers as strategic joint venture partners. However, JSW Steel continues to look for coking coal assets overseas, including Australia, and Canada, Acharya said. Acharya also said the company was open to importing coking coal from Mongolia but as of now there was \"nothing on the radar\". He also opposed a proposal from the trade remedies body against capping imports of low ash metallurgical coke, a steelmaking fuel. \"Putting any kind of duties on materials which we don't internally have, doesn't make strategic sense,\" Acharya said. Last month, Reuters reported that India's steel ministry also did not favour limits on imports of met coke, citing risks to domestic output.",

    "content": "European major Airbus has shortlisted eight sites in India for setting up its final assembly line for H125 helicopters and the ground-breaking ceremony for the facility is expected later this year. The facility, which will be the fourth Final Assembly Line (FAL) for the single engine H125, will initially produce up to 10 helicopters annually and the capacity will be ramped up depending on the market demand, Airbus officials said. \"India is the market of the future for helicopters... at present, the market is extremely embryonic, it is very small compared to what the potential could be,\" Olivier Michalon, Executive Vice President, Global Business of Airbus Helicopters, said. \"We have identified eight sites which we are currently assessing. We are still in the final assessment stage. We should be in a position to announce it shortly. \"We want to be attractive and in an ecosystem that is best suited for industrial activities, logistics, employees and of course, regulations,\" Michalon said at a briefing at Marignane last week. Marignane is the headquarters of Airbus Helicopters. For Airbus, H125 is the most-sold helicopter in India as well as the South Asia region. Airbus has projected the demand for H125 helicopters in India and neighbouring countries at 500 over the next 20 years. \"We are targeting 10 helicopters per year and as the demand picks up we can ramp up,\" Head of Airbus Helicopters in India and South Asia Sunny Guglani said at the briefing. Michalon stressed that 10 might not sound like a lot and it could be 20, 30, or 50 in some years, depending on the market demand. \"We manufacture, sell and support helicopters. Also, we manufacture, sell and support solutions. This is what we can provide. Make In India solutions,\" he said. Highlighting the success story of its narrow-body A320 aircraft, Michalon said, \"H125 is our A320\". H125 can carry up to six people. Airbus is also setting up the FAL for the C295 aircraft in Vadodara, Gujarat. There are around 350 civil and parapublic helicopters in India and South Asia (India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives). Out of them, less than 250 helicopters are in service in India, as per Airbus. In India, there are about 100 Airbus helicopters, with the majority of them being H125 and 130s. There are more than 4,300 H125 helicopters flying around the world. \"The FAL in India will not only make us competitive in terms of lead time, delivery time, it will also help us address the growth of the Indian market and possibly the demand from neighbouring nations. \"This is an important, strategic decision and it will have an impact on our global footprint,\" Michalon said. A basic model of a H125 helicopter could cost around 3.2 million euros, according to a company official. In India, helicopters are used for tourism, pilgrimage, and medical services as well as by the energy sector and private entities. Once set up in India, the FAL for H125 helicopters will undertake the integration of the major component assemblies, avionics and mission systems, installation of electrical harnesses, hydraulic circuits, flight controls, dynamic components, fuel system and the engine. Besides, the FAL will do testing, qualification, and delivery of the H125 to customers in India and the region. About the Indian market, Michalon said the regulations are a bit restrictive but the company is working as if those regulations are going to lighten up a bit and the skies become more open. \"Either we wait for the skies to be fully open and then it is a big rush by all helicopter manufacturers or we demonstrate our trust and recognition potential of India and be ready to invest,\" he said. In January, Airbus and Tata Group announced a partnership to set up India's first helicopter FAL in the private sector. The facility will be set up by Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL), along with Airbus Helicopters.",

    "content": "State-owned Coal India on Monday said it has bagged the first critical mineral asset, a graphite block, in Madhya Pradesh. Owning a graphite asset will give Coal India an advantage in powering green energy transition momentum to an extent, according to a statement. \"Coal India Ltd (CIL) has successfully opened its account in domestic critical mineral asset emerging as the preferred bidder for Khattali Chotti graphite block in Alirajpur district of Madhya Pradesh,\" the PSU said in the statement. With the bagging of this mine, CIL has made its foray into the first-ever non-coal mineral mining venture, the coal behemoth said. \"This was under tranche two forward auction held on 9th July by the Ministry of Mines,\" it said. The company won the bid quoting a mining premium of 150.05 per cent of the value of mineral despatch, which it would pay to the state. CIL will formally receive the letter of intent once it deposits performance security. Further, a composite license will be issued to CIL in a year after the company meets the formalities under the notice inviting tender timeline. The block was put for sale in the second tranche of the critical mine auction. \"CIL under its diversification portfolio won the bid. With this, CIL is poised to play a supporting role in critical minerals domestically,\" it said. The country imports about 69 per cent of its graphite needs - natural, synthetic and end-use products. Currently, the graphite mining industry has limited players, offering space for willing players to venture into this business arena. Graphite has its utility as an anode material in lithium-ion battery manufacturing due to its relatively low cost and energy density. With the electric vehicle market and energy storage systems fast gaining traction, where lithium-ion cells are used, graphite has a big market. The market size for graphite is projected to take a big leap with the absolute demand projected to shoot up at the rate of 25-27 per cent by FY35 from the current level. The PSU had earlier said it is mulling the mining of critical minerals.",

    "content": "Byju Raveendran, an Indian mathematics whiz who soared from teacher to startup billionaire before his education-technology company imploded this year, now faces his biggest test. The future of Raveendran's eponymous Byju's online coaching firm rests with India's courts after the county's biggest startup, once loved by global investors who valued it at $22 billion, crashed below $2 billion in valuation. The 44-year-old founder last week lost control of the company as a tribunal kick-started an insolvency process. Accused of \"financial mismanagement and compliance issues\", the son of a family of teachers from a small village in south India faces a reckoning that will test the ingenuity that made him a poster child for India's startups. An appeals tribunal is expected to hold a hearing on Monday on whether Byju's insolvency process should be quashed after the former billionaire argued in court his company is solvent and that insolvency could shut it down and cost the jobs of 27,000 staff, including teachers. Insolvency also would not bode well for Byju's backers, such as Dutch technology investor Prosus. Raveendran denies the allegations of mismanagement and wrongdoing at his firm, which has in recent months faced lawsuits over unpaid loans and boardroom battles with foreign investors that went public. Potential insolvency is a dramatic turn of events for an entrepreneur described by one person who has worked with him as an extremely passionate and goal-oriented person who might adopt \"an abrasive approach\" in a crisis. Raveendran presented a \"suave, nice and polished\" image, appearing to heed advice, but \"eventually there was a trust deficit\", said another executive who quit last year as a Byju's senior vice president. \"He said things are improving, don't worry, we have the money,\" the former executive said. Raveendran and a Byju's spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. BYJU'S DOWNFALL: 'OUR FAIR SHARE OF MISTAKES' An engineer by training, he started Byju's in 2011 with physical classes after friends urged him to go into teaching. Raveendran, who aced a premier Indian management exam \"with a score of 100 percentile, not once but twice\", according to the company website, started what would become his empire with his wife Divya Gokulnath, 38, a former student of his. In education-obsessed India, Raveendran hit gold by offering online teaching programs priced from $100 to $300. He got a mammoth boost when the COVID-19 pandemic sent students indoors. At the height of his fame in 2021, he and his wife had a net worth of $4 billion, Forbes reckoned. Now all that is in tatters. Behind the reversal of Byju's meteoric success, say executives and advisers who worked with Raveendran, is that he overruled associates and expanded the business through expensive acquisitions, splurging on marketing and being slow to address problems such as sales agents adopting aggressive tactics to mis-sell courses that damaged the company's reputation. With the backing of investors like General Atlantic, Prosus and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropy venture, Raveendran spent millions on acquisitions, and the company says it has 150 million students in over 100 countries. \"While growing fast, as I've accepted multiple times, we've made our fair share of mistakes\", Raveendran told an interviewer last year at the World Economic Forum in Davos. As he battled crises, the CEO also said decisions to lay off some of its then-50,000 employees and slash branding expenses would help strengthen loss-making Byju's and turn its cashflow positive. \"Every country needs a Byju's,\" he said.",

    "content": "India’s car market is on track to reach 20 million units by 2047, helped by promising growth in battery electric vehicles, Suzuki Motor Corp. Executive Vice President Kenichi Ayukawa said. First, the goal is for Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the Japanese carmaker’s subsidiary, to grab 50% market share by 2030, from around 40% for the fiscal year through March. “We’re confident that the Indian market will expand in the mid to long term,” Ayukawa said in an interview. The emergence of India as an economic powerhouse and its expanding middle class present a clear opportunity for the Hamamatsu-based manufacturer, which has been active in the South Asian nation since 1983 and has found success as the top-selling automaker with models such as Swift and Brezza. In order to keep its lead, Suzuki plans to introduce its first-ever EV in India, as well as in Europe, next year after exhibiting its mass production model at the upcoming auto expo in India in January, according to Ayukawa. A total of 4.2 million passenger vehicles were sold in India in the fiscal year ended in March, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. To put that number — and Ayukawa’s prediction — in perspective, 3.1 million passenger cars were sold in the US last year, while Europe saw 15 million in unit sales. China is the world’s largest automobile market with 26 million passenger vehicle sales, according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. Although Suzuki’s planned eVX is a premium electric vehicle, the carmaker will also roll out more affordable and compact models with lighter batteries, according to Ayukawa. Suzuki is targeting 15% of its sales in India to be EVs by 2030, he added. “India faces environmental issues so I think EVs will grow to an extent,” Ayukawa said. Although people are paying more for cars more than they used to, “India remains a price-conscious market,” he added. Even so, car buyers are starting to show greater appetite for crossovers and sport-utility vehicles, according to Ayukawa. Competition is tougher in that segment because it’s a “strong area for Tata and Mahindra,” he said. Tata Motors Ltd., India’s third-biggest carmaker, has already taken the lead in with fully-electric variants of its popular Tiago and Nexon models, and expects its EV business to reach profitability by early 2026. Suzuki will focus on models that can be used for everyday needs, which will require development of new types of batteries, according to Ayukawa. In the future, Suzuki may embark on domestic production of cells in the next 5 to 10 years, he added. As for collaboration in India with Toyota Motor Corp., which forged a strategic partnership with Suzuki in 2019 through a stake of about 5%, Suzuki will likely focus on smaller cars while Toyota will take the lead on bigger models, Ayukawa said. Toyota’s EV technology will also bolster Suzuki’s product development, he added. “We will learn basic know-how from Toyota and gradually make it our own,” Ayukawa said. Suzuki also sees potential in cars powered by compressed natural gas, which is cheaper than gasoline in India, according to Ayukawa. Maruti Suzuki sold 483,000 CNG cars in the latest fiscal period, up 47% from a year earlier. Although Suzuki plans to start operating four plants that convert methane from cow manure into fuel for cars that currently run on CNG, there are challenges ahead, such as monetizing the organic fertilizer that remains after manufacturing the fuel at a large scale, Ayukawa said.",

    "content": "Foreign investors will likely deploy as much as $100 billion in India this fiscal year, drawn to high-tech manufacturing, infrastructure and climate-change projects in the world’s most-populous country, according to a Citigroup Inc. banker. Companies working to help India meet its net-zero goals will be among the beneficiaries of the foreign capital flows, according to K Balasubramanian, head of corporate banking for Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. “Climate transition is playing out in a big way, likely triggering a bout of foreign fund inflows,” Balasubramanian, known as Bala, said in an interview in Mumbai. Bala said capital is flowing into sustainable energy creation strategies like solar, hydrogen and ammonia. On the energy consumption side, electric vehicles are the “real big story,” he said. “Every formidable company is nurturing plans to enter the next generation iteration on electric mobility,” Bala said.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cast himself as a climate champion, and India has made significant investments in clean energy, adding more than 100 gigawatts of capacity in the last 10 years. The country has pledged to install 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy by the end of the decade, and aims to secure $1 trillion in investments in solar power to meet its 2070 net-zero pledge. India has a 181 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) incentive program to manufacture electric-vehicle batteries in the country. Reliance Industries Ltd., JSW Neo Energy Ltd., and Ola Electric Mobility Pvt. are among the companies selected to produce battery capacity and avail incentives under the program. Apart from climate transition, India’s forays into electronics and infrastructure-related manufacturing are gaining prominence with investors abroad, Bala said. “Capital will come to wherever there are pockets of opportunity in terms of production cost advantage,” Bala said. “Then skill and value addition will be the key drivers for such investments.” India is attracting new groups of investors, according to Bala. Middle-eastern sovereign wealth funds are big backers of energy creation projects, while US investors are drawn to technology and consumption-focused companies. European firms invest in high-end tech, and capital from North Asian countries is making its way to India, Bala said. “In Japan itself, 1,600 companies have identified plans of getting into India, as distributors or suppliers to large companies,” Bala said. The New York-based bank has been ramping up its relationships to become the “first port of call,” for foreign investment, Bala said. These include the US-India corridor, where it gets a majority of the business, he said. The bank is also strong in Germany, France and in the Nordic region, and is spending a lot of time in Taiwan, Bala said.",

    "content": "Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corp are trading higher after Reuters reported citing industry source that India's largest oil and gas exploration company has sought a waiver from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control to lift crude oil from Venezuela. The report said ONGC is optimistic of winning an approval, according to a source who declining to be named. Earlier this year, US had reimposed sanctions on Venezuela citing that the country had broken an accord to hold free and fair elections. The Reuters report added that ONGC has been hopeful of recovering $500 million worth of dividends pending since 2014 for the stake it holds in Venezuelan projects. ONGC has instead sought oil instead of the pending dividend, however there has not been much progress on that front so far. Crude oil has rallied this year helped by supply cuts by OPEC+, though a volatility has declined to multi-year lows in June.",

    "content": "Bengaluru-based electric mobility startup Vidyut on Thursday announced the launch of its offline pre-owned EV sales and financing platform. The latest offline services have been made available in Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad and Bengaluru to begin with, while the plans are to expand them into six more markets including Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Lucknow, Agra and Kanpur by the end of this fiscal, Vidyut said. The company said it plans to launch an online marketplace as well in the next six months. Currently, the platform offers resale of electric commercial three-wheelers from brands such as Mahindra, Piaggio, Euler Motors, Greaves and Altigreen, among others, it said. \"Absence of a robust resale market is one of the biggest roadblocks in the acceleration of EV adoption. With the launch of our EV resale platform, we will be focusing on accurate and transparent vehicle and battery valuation. \"Coupled with our battery subscription model and EV financing services, this approach mitigates the risk of the remaining battery life, uncertain resale value, EV loans, thereby accelerating EV adoption,\" said Xitij Kothi, Co-Founder, Vidyut. Vidyut started in November 2021 as a commercial EV financing platform. One of the major hurdles in EV adoption is the lack of accessibility to resale market and resale price discovery of EVs and, therefore, over the last two years, the company has built capabilities to inspect, value, sell and finance pre-owned EVs through its own demand generation platform for used EVs, the company said.",

    "content": "A fertile jump in volume It is that time of the year when fertiliser stocks are in the limelight. And while the markets keep a tab on the progress of the monsoons, they also prefer to keep fertiliser stocks high on their radar during this time. Hence, it comes as no surprise that a large section of traders was focusing on the sudden and swift jump in the volume of many fertiliser stocks on Monday. Traders are of the view that there are strong signs of positive momentum as almost all the stocks from the segment are exhibiting strong Relative Strength Index (RSI) across various timeframes, up to 90 days. Indeed, as Chambal Fertilisers saw nearly 3.5 lakh shares being traded on BSE, as against the two-week average of 2.36 lakh. Similarly, Gujarat State Fertilisers \u0026 Chemicals saw a huge jump with 12.5 lakh shares being traded on Monday, much higher than the two-week average of 4.28 lakh shares. The case was no different for stocks like Rashtriya Chemicals \u0026 Fertilisers, Mangalore Chemicals \u0026 Fertilizers and Shree Pushkar Chemicals \u0026 Fertilisers.  Derivatives segment is in the news on most days nowadays – be it due to regulatory concerns or just the whopping volume it clocks on a daily basis. Three stocks -- Reliance Industries, JSW Steel and NTPC – were quite hotly discussed in the F\u0026O segment on Monday. In the case of RIL, traders say, a massive unwinding of 5,000 future contracts alongside shorting of 4,900 put options suggests a potentially bullish stance even as call option activity remained subdued at around 230 lots. Meanwhile, in the case of JSW Steel, call option buying dominated with 1,460 contracts traded compared to a negligible 12 put options, clearly indicating a bullish outlook. Similar to JSW Steel, NTPC also saw significant call option buying (3,200 contracts) versus minimal put option activity (143 contracts), suggesting a strong positive bias. Is small still beautiful? Small cap stocks have been in the fast lane for long – a fact corroborated by the nearly 26 percent jump in the BSE SmallCap index in the current calendar year till date. This is significantly higher than the benchmark Sensex gain of a little over 11 percent. Concerns around the small cap universe have been lingering for long and those waiting for the small cap bubble – many in the market are actually using the term – to burst have been coming forth with many theories. The latest trend in the market is highlighting events in the US markets. They have been quick in circulating messages stating that small cap stocks in the US are down around two percent in CY24 even as large caps are up over 17 percent. They say that this is the highest margin of outperformance since 1998 and hence needs to be taken seriously. The trend could mirror in India and so be extra cautious when it comes to putting more money in small caps, they say.",

    "content": "Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra \u0026 Mahindra Ltd. are closing in on Hyundai Motor Co.’s No. 2 position in India, putting pressure on the South Korean automaker just as it prepares for a record $3.5 billion listing of its local unit. While Hyundai has long wrestled with Tata Motors for the second spot, Mahindra — famed for its big, brash sport utility vehicles — has been steadily climbing up the charts as Indian consumers embrace ever larger passenger vehicles. Hyundai sold 13.5% of all passenger cars in India last month, while Jaguar Land Rover-owner Tata Motors sold 13.2% versus Mahindra’s 12.4%, data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations show. Maruti Suzuki Ltd. is by far and away India’s top carmaker, with a 40% share. The tussle for sales in India, one of the world’s fastest-growing automobile markets, comes just as Hyundai Motor India Ltd. plans to start gauging investor interest ahead of an expected initial public offering in September or October. An IPO of that size would also be one of Asia’s biggest in recent years. Hyundai is a “true leader compared to competitors, holding first and second rank in many categories,” Hyundai India CEO Unsoo Kim said during an investor presentation last week. But Chief Operating Officer Tarun Garg acknowledged that considering the many foreign automakers that have exited the country, “India is not an easy market to crack.” Hyundai is spending around 200 billion rupees ($2.4 billion) in India to develop electric vehicles — still a nascent sector in a country whose road transport industry is characterized by older, gas guzzling trucks and cars — and 70 billion rupees to get its second plant there operational by the back end of 2025. To woo consumers more interested in environmentally friendlier cars, it plans to launch an electric version of its bestselling mid-sized SUV, Creta, in the first quarter of 2025, according to the investor presentation. Tata Motors meanwhile is expanding its EV portfolio by adding 10 models by fiscal 2026. Mahindra plans to invest 270 billion rupees over the next three years to add capacity for making SUVs, as well as EVs. It hopes to launch nine diesel and gas-powered SUVs and seven EVs by 2030. Maruti Suzuki, although it leads India’s car market, currently doesn’t sell any battery-powered cars. “If some market share is lost by Hyundai, that can largely be attributed to product range,” said Deven Choksey, managing director at KR Choksey Shares \u0026 Securities Pvt. Tata Motors and Mahindra, with their appealing designs and competitive pricing, are “extremely challenging brands for all carmakers in India today,” Choksey said.",

So we feel we should be able to close the year with a double-digit growth as projected earlier.\"",

    "content": "Maruti Suzuki India plans to utilise Indian Railways to transport 35 per cent of the vehicles produced across its factories over the next 7-8 years, according to MD and CEO Hisashi Takeuchi. The share of vehicle dispatches through railways scaled to 21.5 per cent in the 2023-24 fiscal from 5 per cent in 2014-15. The country's largest carmaker's vehicle dispatches through railways increased from 65,700 units in 2014-15 to 4,47,750 units in 2023-24. Maruti Suzuki has so far dispatched over 20 lakh units through Indian Railways. The automaker ferries vehicles to 20 destinations, serving over 450 cities using Indian railways. Takeuchi said the company pioneered the use of railways for vehicle dispatches over a decade ago by becoming the first company in India to obtain the Automobile-Freight-Train-Operator license. Since then, the company has systematically increased its share of vehicle dispatches using railways, he added. \"Through our sustained efforts in green logistics, we have achieved outstanding results including cumulative reduction of 10,000 metric tonne of CO2 emissions and 270 million litre of cumulative fuel savings,\" Takeuchi noted. The company stands committed to the country's net zero emissions target by 2070, he added. Earlier this year, under the PM Gati Shakti programme, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the country's first automobile in-plant railway siding at Maruti Suzuki's Gujarat facility. This facility has a capacity to dispatch 3 lakh vehicles per annum. The next in-plant railway siding is in progress at the company's Manesar facility and will be operational soon, the automaker stated.",

Welspun One's focus for fund 2 is on new-age warehousing assets, such as urban distribution centres, cold chain, agro logistics, and port and airport-based logistics, the statement said. Balkrishan Goenka, Chairman of Welspun World, said, \"Our commitment to advancing critical logistics infrastructure is in perfect alignment with India's strategic objective of reducing logistics costs from 14 per cent to 8 per cent, thereby enhancing the global competitiveness of our industries.\" By making investments in essential infrastructure, he said the fund aims to streamline logistics operations and stimulate industrial growth.

The portfolio includes clients such as Tata Croma, Delhivery, FM Logistics, Asian Paints, and Ecom Express, amongst others. Welspun One is the warehousing platform of the USD 5 billion global conglomerate Welspun World, which is one of India's fastest-growing multinationals with a leadership position in line pipes, home textiles, infrastructure, advanced textiles, and flooring solutions.",

HDFC Bank said to mull loan portfolio sale amid growth scrutinyRelated stories",
    "content": "HDFC Bank Ltd. is mulling the sale of a loans portfolio, according to people familiar with the matter, amid heightened regulatory scrutiny on the nation’s lenders as their credit growth surges. India’s biggest private sector bank has approached public sector lenders, non-banking finance companies as well as some insurance companies and asset managers about participating in the sale, said the people, who requested anonymity discussing private conversations. A measure of how much of a bank’s deposits are being lent out as loans — known as the credit-deposit ratio — has drawn scrutiny from the Reserve Bank of India as that gauge for the nation’s industry stands at a decade high. Selling some of its loan portfolio would go some ways to help HDFC bring that down following an increase in the wake of its 2023 merger with the bank’s parent HDFC Ltd. and may also aid its liquidity. A spokesperson for Mumbai-based HDFC Bank didn’t reply to an email request for comment. Shares of the bank fell the most in a month on Friday after it reported flat sequential deposit performance in the quarter ended June. HDFC Bank Shares Fall Most in a Month After 1Q Deposits Miss With loans growing significantly faster than deposits in India, where the economy’s expanding toward 8%, decision makers at banks are under pressure to address potential financial risks that are building. India’s central bank has also asked banks to raise buffers for some consumer loans as it tries to keep a cap on evolving risks. The banking industry’s credit-deposit ratio stood at 80.3% in March, a decade high, according to RBI data. That has eased since, though remains elevated at 77.9% as of June 14. Bank deposits in India grew 12.6% annually through June 14, compared with 19.2% loan growth, the latest RBI data show. “The persisting gap between credit and deposit growth rates warrants a rethink by the boards of banks to re-strategize their business plans,” the Reserve Bank of India said in a monthly bulletin last month. “A prudent balance between assets and liabilities has to be maintained,” it said. HDFC’s credit-deposit ratio rose as high as 110% after the merger, according to a report by ICRA Ratings, the local arm of Moody’s Investors Inc. It’s since dropped to 104% at the end of the last fiscal year, though remains above the average of between 85%-88% in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2023. The firm’s total loans expanded about 53% to 24.87 trillion rupees at the end of June, compared with a 24% expansion in deposits during the same period.",

    "content": "UBS Group AG’s India operation is losing another senior executive to competitors, at a time when the firm is still charting its strategy to manage wealth in the country, according to people familiar with the matter. Aditya Goenka, a Mumbai-based managing director in structured lending, is leaving to join HSBC Holdings Plc in its commercial banking business, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is private. UBS, which exited India’s onshore wealth business about a decade ago, is seeking to lean on the Credit Suisse team it acquired to make a comeback there. While margins in India are slimmer than other markets, the firm sees there is opportunity in managing both the business and personal assets of clients benefiting from the boom in the stock market and economy. Goenka has been at Credit Suisse for more than 11 years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He was previously with Bank of America Corp. for nearly eight years, according to the profile. Spokespeople from UBS and HSBC declined to comment. Goenka didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. At HSBC, Goenka will join his ex-Credit Suisse colleague Rajat Sabharwal who led its equities business in the country until the end of last year, according to his LinkedIn profile. Sabharwal is now in a similar role at HSBC, the profile states. Other Credit Suisse departees are Sudipto Sinha, an executive director, who is now a business head at Angel One Wealth, as well as Sandipan Roy, the head of product development, who is now the chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Wealth Management Ltd. Liechtenstein royal family-backed LGT Wealth India hired veteran relationship manager Ajay Punjabi as well as Chirag Doshi to lead its fixed income business. Vijay Shah, the head of advisory and sales in wealth management, also left the bank to start his own business, according to his LinkedIn profile. Credit Suisse had just over 40 wealth management employees in India, and around 7,000 people overall in the country, a spokesperson at the bank told Bloomberg News in April last year. About a month ago, UBS’ co-head for Asia-Pacific wealth management Jin Yee Young visited India, which she called a key strategic market. The firm is rebuilding in markets such as India, according to its Asia Pacific president Edmund Koh. “It’s a good market for us, but still early days in India, still a lot of heavy lifting to do,” Koh had said.",

    "content": "Mercedes-Benz India wants the government to commit to continuity in policies that support electric mobility for the next eight to ten years, for stable and better planning towards zero emission mobility, its Managing Director and CEO Santosh Iyer said on Tuesday. Besides, the company feels that providing the incentives given to electric vehicles to hybrid vehicles will extend the timeline for transition to emission free mobility. The company, which had increased EV penetration to 6 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, from 2.5 per cent earlier, expects the momentum to carry going forward with three new EV models slated for launch this year, starting with the EQA next week. \"We understand that the Budget may not address the GST topic, but at least if you are able to get a commitment that for the next eight to ten years, this kind of taxation benefit will continue, this will really help brands like us to plan long term and have more commitments when it comes to investments for the EVs,\" he said. For electric vehicles the government has already given 5 per cent GST compared to 48-50 per cent on internal combustion engines, Iyer added. Highlighting investment on infrastructure as another key aspect, he said, \"One of the biggest drivers for our growth has been the growing road infrastructure and intercity road infrastructure that has come up in the last couple of years.\" He further said, \"one big line item that we will see in the Budget is the capital expenditure on infrastructure. We expect (it) to go up if possible, so that not only it helps demand but also the indirect benefits of it for the country also is great.\" When asked about the discussions on extending the GST benefits given to EVs on hybrid vehicles, Iyer said, \"Currently we can see electric as the only option when it comes to zero emission driving. Now on that road, if we add newer technologies, it will delay the transition, for sure.\" Iyer further said, \"It is up to the government and the stakeholders to see how soon they want to accelerate the transformation to carbon free mobility and emission free mobility.\" On the company's roadmap for electric mobility, he said it is committed to zero emission mobility but \"the EV transition is a marathon and not a sprint\". \"We have already three (EV) products in the market with which we achieved 5-6 per cent penetration and we will continue with the EQA (to be launched next week) to further penetrate,\" Iyer said. Two more EV models will be launched later this year, he added. In the first quarter of 2024, the company had posted total sales of 5,412 units, growth of 15 per cent from the year-ago period. On local assembly of EVs in India, Iyer said Mercedes-Benz India will consider other models too depending on demand. It currently assembles EQS at its Chakan plant.",

Is it a case of true industry solidarity or concerns that they could be the next to face regulatory scrutiny?",

    "content": "Highlights  With an aggregate capacity of 152.7 MTPA, Ultratech enjoys a market share of ~23 percent on a pan-India basis. However, its market share in the south is just about 10-11 percent. The management had earlier indicated that it was looking to consolidate its presence in the south, which remains very fragmented because of many small and mid-sized players. In our view, UltraTech will be looking to further increase its stake in the company and may launch an open offer in the coming months to gain control over the operations.  Birla and Adani fighting for leadership  The stake sale comes at a point when the Indian cement industry is undergoing a wave of consolidation. The sector has already witnessed four strategic acquisitions in the last 20 months. The Adani group-owned Ambuja Cements, the second-largest cement player in the domestic market, has been on an aggressive capacity expansion spree and has readied a substantial cash war chest (~$3 billion) to target M\u0026A opportunities. Ambuja recently announced the acquisition of south-based cement company Penna Cement (14 MT capacity) at an enterprise value of Rs 10,422 crore. The group has reiterated its ambition to reach 140MT cement capacity by 2028. The fight for market leadership between the Birlas and the Adanis is intensifying as UltraTech is looking to achieve a production capacity of 200 MT in the next 3-4 years.",

    "content": "Apple'S iPhone maker Foxconn on June 27 informed the Central government that around 25 percent its new employees are married women and its safety protocol, which requires everyone to avoid wearing metal irrespective of gender or religion, is not discriminatory, sources familiar with the matter said. The Taiwanese company shared an informal note with the government after reports suggested it is not hiring married women. The company said that such stipulations are not part of its policy and these claims may have been made by those disgruntled individuals who were not hired, sources said. They added that such media reports malign the fast-growing Indian manufacturing sector. \"Foxconn had clarified that 25 percent of the latest hires are married women. This would mean nearly one-third of the total women are married. This ratio compares favourably to any factory in this sector currently operating in India,\" one of the sources said. The Foxconn factory currently has about 70 percent women and 30 percent men and the Tamil Nadu plant is the largest factory for women employment in the country with the total employment having touched 45,000 workers during peak periods, they said. The company has also informed that the discussion around Hindu married women being discriminated against for wearing metals (ornaments and jewelry) is \"entirely slanted\" and wearing metal in such factories is a safety issue, a fact well recognised by both the industry and the government. \"Any person wearing metals - man or woman - regardless of their status (single or married) and their religion (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh etc.) are required to remove metals while working in the factory,\" the source said quoting the company's informal note. For safety reasons, no one wearing metal is allowed to work on the shop floor and this is a prevalent practice in several industries. According to sources, the company has stated that the media report is based on anecdotal comments by 5-10 people or potential job seekers. These comments likely came from candidates who did not get the job or no longer work at Foxconn. No immediate comments were received from Foxconn in response to an email query sent to the company on the matter. (With agency inputs)",

The pricing was eventually lowered, and the electric vehicle (EV) was available until now for Rs 23.84 lakhs (ex-showroom). While Hyundai did drop costs by over Rs 2 lakh at the end, the introduction of smaller and cheaper e-SUVs, ranging from the Tata Nexon EV and MG ZS EV to the Mahindra XUV400, meant that the EV was positioned higher and had even less market traction. The age of the vehicle —which has been on the market for the past five years without any modifications—may be one of the factors contributing to its discontinuation, as per reports. Another explanation would be to provide room in the EV lineup for the Hyundai Creta Electric, which is presently in development and should be on display in showrooms by January 2025, reports add. Hyundai Kona EV: About The Vehicle The Hyundai Kona is powered by a permanent magnet synchronous motor with 136 horsepower and 395 Nm of torque. It comes equipped with a 39.2 kWh lithium-ion battery. The claimed acceleration time from 0 to 100 km/h is 9.7 seconds. There are three driving modes available: eco, comfort, and sport. The vehicle offers adjustable regenerative braking with paddle shifters. A 50 kW DC fast charger can charge the battery to 80 per cent capacity in around 57 minutes, while a regular AC charger takes 6 hours and 10 minutes. When fully charged, it claimed to have a driving range of 452 km. Some of the features were a 7.0-inch dashboard screen, an 8.0-inch touchscreen entertainment system, a head-up display, automated climate control, a sunroof, heated ORVMs, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated electrically adjustable front seats, and a reverse camera with parking sensors. Meanwhile, the next Hyundai Creta electric will be significantly localised in India and is projected to have a range of up to 500 kilometres on a full charge.",

    "content": "An India government investigation found lapses in the corporate governance of Byju’s, but cleared the struggling online-education startup of financial fraud. The yearlong probe by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs found no evidence of wrongdoing such as siphoning of funds or manipulation of financial accounts, people familiar with the matter said. Still, it discovered governance shortcomings that contributed to the startup’s mounting losses, the people said, asking not to be named as the investigators’ report isn’t public yet. Representatives of the corporate affairs ministry, Byju’s, Peak XV and Prosus didn’t respond to requests for comment. The report doesn’t directly address whether Raveendran personally is at fault for the governance lapses or whether he is qualified to run the company. The disgruntled investors have sought his removal, citing management and compliance failures. The report also does little to stave off the company’s broader problems. The unprofitable startup’s quick expansion led to a cash crunch and a plunge in its valuation, and it’s now fighting multiple lawsuits in India and the US. The probe found that weak corporate governance and compliance practices, along with a change in the funding environment, contributed to its ballooning losses, the people said. Investigators also concluded that that startup failed to bring in professionals to oversee finances and compliance, which led to the losses, the people said. The report establishes that Byju’s didn’t disclose full details of acquisitions with all directors and that meetings to approve such deals were called at short notice. But it acknowledges the founders’ rationale that some directors were also investors at rival companies, according to the people. The ed-tech company was valued at $22 billion at its peak. Business surged during the two years of the Covid-19 pandemic but as infections subsided and classrooms resumed, its cash pile shrinked. It’s now battling several bankruptcy cases in India and overseas. Though Byju’s has managed to raise more than $100 million from existing investors through a fresh issuance of shares, an Indian court has barred it from using that money.",

    "content": "Karnataka IT-BT Minister Priyank Kharge alleged on June 25 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pressuring companies to invest in Gujarat by blocking investments intended for Karnataka. Speaking to reporters at Vikasa Soudha in Bengaluru, Kharge said he knows which companies they are, but did not reveal their names. \"We are making every effort to attract investors to Karnataka, but the PM himself is calling and pressuring them to invest in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. There are also instances of pressure on those who intend to invest in Telangana. We will disclose everything in the future,\" he said. His comments come against the backdrop of Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Steel HD Kumaraswamy questioning subsidies offered for US-based microchip manufacturer Micron Technology to set up a chip assembly facility in Gujarat. Kumaraswamy later claimed he was 'misquoted' in the media. Karnataka Minister for Large and Medium Industries MB Patil had also accused the Union government of favoring Gujarat, the Prime Minister's home state. Kharge said he will meet Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on June 27 to seek similar incentives for companies interested in investing in Karnataka, similar to those offered in Gujarat. He said there is a huge demand for human resources in Karnataka, adding, \"We are not competing with other states in India but with China, Vietnam, and others.\" Potential investments worth $6.2 billion from recent foreign visits A delegation from the Karnataka Department of Electronics, IT, and BT recently visited the US, UK, France, and Germany to attract investments, showcase startups, and promote international technology and innovation collaboration. Sharath Bachegowda, Chairman of Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation Ltd, who was part of the delegation, said there are potential investments worth $6.2 billion from these recent foreign visits but did not disclose the conversion rate or employment generation resulting from these promises. The delegation met with Stanford Biodesign representatives interested in expanding their Founders’ Forum initiative to Bengaluru. \"They will soon sign an MoU with the Karnataka government to collaborate on Stanford Biodesign’s Med-Tech startup mentorship and accelerator program. “Detailed proposals and budgets were reviewed, with plans for the Stanford Biodesign team to visit Karnataka in July to advance discussions,” said Ekroop Caur, secretary, IT-BT department. Bachegowda said the delegation conducted a series of meetings during the visit. On June 5, they engaged with Applied Materials, Jabil, and Bloom Energy in the US, focusing on semiconductor manufacturing in Karnataka. The delegation also held discussions with Ambient Photonics Inc. and Microchip Technology Inc. highlighting academic partnerships and potential collaborations with Karnataka’s Centers of Excellence. Additionally, meetings with Arm Holdings explored expanding operations and strategic support in Beyond Bengaluru clusters. In the UK, discussions at the Microsoft Technology Centre covered AI frameworks, quantum technology, and digital transformations. At London Tech Week, talks with Startup Genome centered on the 2024 Global Startup Ecosystem Report and collaborations under the Hyper Growth Acceleration programme, aimed at supporting 100 startups in Enterprise Tech, SaaS, and Fintech with funding from private players and collaboration with 87 Venture Capitalists.",

On May 6, the high court had granted interim bail for two months on medical grounds to Goyal, arrested in a money laundering case by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Goyal, 75, has now filed an application seeking extension of the same. The application came up for hearing on Tuesday before a single bench of Justice Manish Pitale. The court referred to a circular issued by the high court in February, stating that the applications where earlier pleas were considered and decided by a particular judge shall be placed before the same bench. Justice Pitale directed the high court's registry department to place Goyal's application before the single bench of Justice N J Jamadar, who had granted him interim bail in May for two months. Goyal's counsels Aabad Ponda and Ameet Naik said they would mention the plea before Justice Jamadar on Wednesday. Goyal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in September 2023 on the allegations that he had laundered money and siphoned off loans to the tune of Rs 538.62 crore given to Jet Airways by Canara Bank. His wife, Anita Goyal was arrested in November 2023 when the ED submitted its chargesheet in the case. She was granted bail by the special court the same day considering her age and medical condition. She died on May 16.",

    "content": "Public washroom automation firm Euronics is looking to double its turnover to Rs 400 crore by 2025-26 with its new manufacturing plant at Gurugram set to become operational to fulfil 50 per cent of its orders. The company has invested Rs 100 crore to set up the washroom automation accessories production unit at Gurugram with an annual production capacity of 2 lakh units and it will become operational this month. \"In the last financial year we were around Rs 200 crore... This year we are looking at close to Rs 280 crore to Rs 290 crore and in FY25-26 we are chasing Rs 400 crore turnover,\" Euronics MD \u0026 CEO Viknesh Jain told PTI. Established in 2002, Euronics is a major player in India's public and commercial washroom sector, he said, with growth fuelled by the expansive growth of the country's public infrastructure, commercial real estate, and retail sectors. While initially it catered mainly to the private sector, including several Fortune 500 companies, Jain said in the past six to seven years it has started getting a lot of government projects. Euronics had recently undertaken washroom automation for Ram Mandir in Ayodhya; Yashobhoomi (India International Convention \u0026 Expo Center), New Parliament Building, airports across Ayodhya, Mumbai, Delhi, Goa, and Bangalore among other cities, and other smart city projects in India, Jain added. With the new plant coming in, the company said it will be able to fulfill 50 per cent of its average order volumes from the Gurugram unit alone. The unit will create around 200 blue-collar jobs. \"When we started it was more like contract manufacturing but right now around 50-60 per cent of the products which are sold by us are produced by us. The idea is to increase it to 80 per cent by the next year-end,\" Jain said. Currently, Euronics has other plants in Jamnagar, Greater Noida, and Bhiwadi. Bullish on India's public infrastructure sector, he said Euronics is set to meet its washroom automation needs with 100 per cent domestically manufactured accessories within the next three years.",

    "content": "Passenger vehicle sales is projected to grow at a moderate 3-5 per cent this financial year on account of a high-base effect of FY24, shrinking order book and subdued demand for entry-level variants, a report said on Monday. According to the report by credit ratings agency CareEdge, following robust growth of 90 per cent with volumes at 90,432 units in FY24, with an improving penetration rate, electric car sales in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment is likely to clock volume of around 1.30-1.50 lakh units in FY25. In FY22 and FY23, the PV industry experienced substantial year-on-year volume growth due to pent-up demand post-Covid recovery and new product introductions, it said. According to CareEdge, utility vehicles contributed 10-15 per cent of total passenger vehicle sales until FY12. It grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.51 per cent between FY13 and FY24, as consumer preference shifted towards utility vehicles that offered better and innovative designs, new models, technological, functional and safety features. For the past decade, the utility vehicles segment has consistently outperformed the passenger vehicle industry growth rate. In FY24, for the first time utility vehicles sales volume stood higher than passenger cars and vans, it said. Currently, utility vehicles account for over 55 per cent of all new PV sales and its share in overall passenger vehicle (PV) sales is expected to further rise over the medium-term, CareEdge said. \"The PV industry is expected to exhibit moderate volume growth of around 3-5 per cent in FY25 on account of a high-base effect of FY24, shrinking orderbook and expectation of persistently subdued demand for entry-level variants in FY25,\" said Arti Roy, Associate Director at CareEdge Ratings. Strong demand for new model launches and SUVs coupled with the expectation of interest rate cuts in the second half of FY25 is expected to keep the sales momentum rolling, she added. However, in line with CareEdge Ratings' expectation of volume growth of around 7-9 per cent in FY24, the PV industry volumes grew by 7.4 per cent in FY24, the ratings said. This moderation in year-on-year volume growth in FY24 was due to the levelling off of pent-up demand amid a hike in vehicle prices, high base effect of FY23 and the high-interest rate environment, it said. Strong order book in FY24, robust demand for new model launches and increasing demand in the sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment kept the sales momentum rolling, as per the report. \"While the market for premium vehicles is predicted to thrive, driven by a surge in demand for luxury and high-end models, entry-level variants are likely to see continued diminished demand due to a downturn in both rural and urban markets,\" said Hardik Shah, Director at CareEdge Ratings. The rural sector is feeling the pinch as entry-level vehicles are becoming more expensive, whereas urban consumers are increasingly opting for SUVs, reflecting a shift in market preferences, Shah added.",

    "content": "Yarn of a different kind Nandan Denim has been a hot favourite among stock-market gurus for a few months now. They have been taking viewers through the company website and highlighting its financials. They claim that the company is a multi-bagger that is waiting to be discovered. But they have missed out a few points though -- one, the company's statutory auditor resigned on June 17, saying that they are not being paid enough for the volume of work and that their requests to increase the fee has not been “considered favourably” by the management. The social-media influencers also do not mention anything about the SEBI order asking the company why its Risk Management Committee did not meet as frequently as is required by law. Its committee met after a gap of 225 days, when the law clearly states that the committee has to meet once every 180 days. Meanwhile, the stock kept climbing and climbing – the shares are up 138 percent in the last one year -- till June 21, when it crashed around six percent. A day earlier, on June 20, a promoter group entity Chiriipal Exim sold 25 lakh shares.  Right now, everything looks good in the stock market. Yes, there are those intermittent corrections and falls but the long-term prospects look solid on the back of a strong domestic investor base. But a large part of the retail investor base is relatively new and has mostly seen only a strong upswing in markets. Simply put, they have not experienced huge losses and may lack the expertise to handle a downfall. This assumes significance as a large section of experts are advising caution on the possibility of the global “bubble” bursting any time soon. They are comparing it to Japan’s fall – the Nikkei has fallen nearly six percent after touching a record high in March. Experts believe that markets, across the world may be ill-prepared for such an event, especially from the point of view of new investors. While there is a counter theory as well that markets like India and China could actually gain from such a global bubble bursting, they believe that some amount of caution would not really harm anyone. Betting on barren Dubai was always a preferred destination for many rich and uber-rich Indians who were looking to invest in real estate. Bollywood celebrities appearing in advertising commercials for Dubai properties is also not a recent trend. But while earlier it was all about buying residential or commercial properties in ultra-premium and marquee projects, the recent past has seen an increased interest from Indian HNIs for buying barren lands in the Middle East. While there may be no development or return visible in the next few years, experts believe that Indians are placing a decade-long bet. The reason - climatic predictions. Experts say these regions will receive more rainfall in the coming years – it is a fact that rainfall has been increasing in Dubai over the past decades -- and hence will turn green and profitable. This, in turn, will push real estate prices higher, they say.",

    "content": "The Indian mining company controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal is considering tapping bond markets for at least $500 million in a debut overseas issuance, according to two people familiar with the proposal. Vedanta Ltd. is discussing the plan with lenders and seeking legal opinions about the potential sale, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing non-public issues. The bond sale could climb to $1 billion depending on the response from investors, according to one of the people. The company is also exploring other avenues of fundraising, including equity sales and local currency loans from domestic banks, the people said. The move comes at a time when four high-yield dollar bonds sold by Vedanta’s parent company, Vedanta Resources Ltd., are the top performers from India so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The holding company earlier this year successfully restructured its offshore bonds. Vedanta Ltd. has historically sold local currency bonds and borrowed in rupees from local lenders. Last week, the company’s board approved the sale of 10 billion rupees ($120 million) in local, non-convertible debentures. Vedanta has interests in semiconductors and commodities including aluminum, oil and gas, iron and copper. While largely concentrated in India, it has operations in South Africa, Namibia and Liberia as well. The 2024-25 fiscal year is lining up to be a critical one for Vedanta, Executive Director Arun Misra said during an analysts’ call on April 25, when he discussed plans for $1.9 billion in capex spending. The dollar bond sale would provide revenue for that expansion. In an overhaul announced last year, Agarwal is working to divide the company into six different business units: Vedanta Ltd. would control the semiconductor, zinc and stainless steel business. The company said the split would be completed in the fiscal year ending in March 2025.",

Banerjee previously held the positions of Head of Content for Hindi Entertainment \u0026 Disney+ Hotstar and Business Head for Star Bharat, Hindi \u0026 English Movies, Kids \u0026 Infotainment, and Regional (East), the statement said. He started career in media as an assistant producer and anchor at Aaj Tak and later moved to Star News, where he started producing and anchoring prime time news shows. Banerjee has a master's degree in filmmaking and TV production from Jamia Millia Islamia University and an undergraduate in history from St. Stephens, Delhi, the company said. Banerjee's appointment follows Singh's decision to move on, which was announced last month. Singh had said that after nearly 44 years in his career, he is \"ready to focus on social change and shift from operational roles to advisory ones\". The Japanese parent of SPNI, had pushed for Singh to lead the merged entity proposed to be formed after amalgamation with India's Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) before calling off the USD 10 billion deal in January this year. The deal announced more than two years back, collapsed following a stalemate over who will lead the merged entity and also due failure to meet closing conditions by ZEEL despite a month's extension of deadline.",

    "content": "Kotak Mahindra Bank will increase its pace of opening new branches and add about 175 to 200 branches in the financial year 2024-25, a senior official at the bank said, months after the central bank barred the private lender from sourcing new customers digitally. In April, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stopped Kotak from adding new customers via its online and mobile banking channels, and from issuing new credit cards, due to information technology-related deficiencies. \"We have been adding roughly 150 odd branches for several years now. This year too, the momentum is going to continue,\" Virat Diwanji, group president and head - consumer bank, told Reuters in an email interview on Monday. Before the RBI's order, Kotak was heavily reliant on digital channels to source new clients. About 95% of its new personal loans by volume were disbursed digitally in the October-December quarter, while it issued 99% of new credit cards through digital channels. A similar breakup for the January-March quarter is not yet available. Kotak's branch addition plans may not immediately help source new customers, but the strategy may play out in the medium-to-longer term as it will increase its presence and reach, said Kranthi Baithini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities. However, that will come with high overhead costs, he said. Meanwhile, the bank is working \"steadfastly\" to fulfill the RBI's requirements and return to business as usual, Diwanji said. The private lender has stepped up investments to fortify its IT systems, including steps to strengthen its digital payment security controls and meet regulatory data cybersecurity standards, he added. Kotak has hired over 530 employees in the last 12-15 months, a majority of them from tech backgrounds, he said. The bank's focus on personal loans and business loans will continue, Diwanji said.",

    "content": "ArcelorMittal's India joint venture has privately warned trade officials in New Delhi that a plan to curb imports of a key raw material for steelmaking overlooks the implications of the Red Sea crisis, a letter showed. The curbs planned by the world's second-biggest producer of crude steel could hit output, as they cap imports of a steelmaking fuel, low ash metallurgical coke, also known as met coke, at 2.85 million metric tons for a year. The April proposal, which came after growing shipments caused \"serious injury\" to domestic producers, also recommended setting quotas on met coke for exporting nations. Quotas envisioned for European countries under the plan \"will very seriously affect\" imports from the region, it added. The company, India's commerce ministry and the trade remedies body did not respond to requests for comment. No date has yet been set for the proposal, now being reviewed by the commerce ministry, to take effect. India's plan to allot about 40% import quota to European nations will affect ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India) as the Red Sea crisis has already forced rerouting of vessels, and boosted ocean shipping rates, the company said. The company does not use domestic met coke. India's imports oMost Usedf the fuel have more than doubled over the past four years, and its top suppliers include Poland and Switzerland, as well as China and Indonesia. Attacks on ships in the Red Sea by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi militants are disrupting trade, with freight firms switching to routes around the Cape of Good Hope to avoid the Suez Canal. India must reconsider the proposal as it could hit the steel industry, the company, which has not commented on the matter publicly, urged in its letter. This month, Reuters reported that India's steel ministry also did not favour limits on imports of met coke, citing risks to domestic output. In its letter, AM/NS India said authorities proposing the curbs did not factor in the prospect of increased demand for met coke as steelmakers plan to add capacity. \"The quantiative restraint on imports will reduce the ability for the steel industry to raise its capacity and growth levels,\" it added. One of India's leading steelmakers, with annual capacity of about 9 million metric tons, AM/NS India competes with JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd.",

    "description": "According to the latest Kantar FMCG pulse report, this trend is expected to rise further with intensifying summer.More than 50% Indian households downing soft drinks; to increase with intensifying heat: ReportRelated stories",
    "content": "The average Indian household's consumption of bottled soft drinks has increased in the last two years, breaching annual penetration of 50 per cent in FY24, a report said. According to the latest Kantar FMCG pulse report, this trend is expected to rise further with intensifying summer. It said the average household has expanded its consumption of bottled soft drinks by 250 ml in the last two years. Besides, washing liquids, another premium laundry product introduced by leading FMCG majors, breached the 100,000-tonne mark in FY24. All these trends are \"record breakers\", the report noted. The bottled soft drink category had a \"massive 41 per cent household growth in MAT (moving annual total) March 2023\" and continued to add more households and expanded 19 per cent in MAT March 2024. \"With the intensifying summer, the category is likely to continue its growth this year too,\" it said. On the consumption, the report said now consumers shop FMCG products 156 times a year, or every 56 hours from online or offline channels. However, it also added that the average basket value has gone down as shoppers are no longer buying more packs as they were purchasing earlier. \"The frequency and the pack trends indicate that shoppers are no longer reducing their pack sizes, but holding on to the ones they are buying. In other words, we are very likely at the juncture where we see shoppers buying slightly bigger packs from now on,\" it said. Now discretionary premium-end categories like washing liquids and indulgent products such as bottled soft drinks have performed exceedingly well. Still, groceries are the biggest household expense, accounting for over 24 per cent of all quarterly expenses in a household, it added. The report also highlighted that though inflation might have slowed to acceptable levels, its effects are not lost on the consumer. \"The worst of inflation is behind us, however, there are pockets of the market that are still under some stress...the shopper is looking at the future with great optimism, even those who are under stress, and this optimism has been the flag bearer of the Indian consumption story for long now,\" it said.",

    "content": "Foreign inflows into Indian bonds will hit a decade-high of $2 billion around June 28, when they will be included in a widely-tracked JPMorgan index, although the central bank will lap up most of the dollars to avoid a knee-jerk rise in the rupee, bankers said. The $2 billion, single-day inflow estimate by four bankers trails only the record-high $2.7 billion poured into Indian bonds on Aug. 20, 2014, as prospects of a credit rating upgrade gained traction. More than $200 billion in assets track the JPMorgan Emerging Market Index in which India will eventually have a weight of 10% by March 2025, suggesting total passive inflows of at least $20 billion over the 10-month period. \"It's just a case of inflows, this time in debt instead of equities,\" the source said. \"It might be positive for the rupee and might be positive for FX reserves as well.\" The source and the bankers requested anonymity as they are not authorised to speak to the media. The RBI did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Since the rupee's real effective exchange rate -- a gauge of its relative value against a basket of currencies -- is signaling it is moderately over-valued, the RBI is wary of any significant appreciation, the source said. So, while front-running in anticipation of the inflows may boost the rupee, a large rally is unlikely given the central bank's grip on the currency, the bankers said. The RBI has said it will continue to boost its forex reserves opportunistically, which, in turn, helps avoid a sudden surge in the rupee. Since there is no precedent for these debt index-related inflows, bankers' estimates of the timing of flows are based on similar index adjustments in the equity markets. \"Obviously, all this is a first and you can't be sure how things will be,\" the head of trading at a large foreign bank cautioned. \"However, based on how portfolio flows related to (equity) rebalancing happen, the money will come in on (June) 27 or 28.\" In anticipation, large foreign banks could look at building short dollar/rupee positions to help manage inflows when they happen, an FX trader at a foreign bank said. Still, despite the best-laid plans, concerns persist. As a senior banker at a large foreign bank said: \"all the pipes that have been put in place might not work.\"",

The proposed plant at Lara in Chhattisgarh will produce 10 tonnes per day (TPD) of 4G ethanol from flue gases emitted from power plants, a company statement said. Using the latest carbon capture technology by Veolia Carbon Clean, the plant will capture 25 TPD CO2 from flue gases, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it said.

As the licensing, engineering, procurement, and construction (LEPC) partner, Jakson Green will spearhead this project which is expected to begin operations within two years. The plant has been conceptualized and designed by NETRA (NTPC Energy Technology Research Alliance), the research and development arm of NTPC Ltd. Kannan Krishnan, Joint Managing Director of Jakson Green Private Limited, said in the statement, \"This partnership builds upon the success of our numerous joint projects... Increasing the production of ethanol is crucial to achieving India's blending goals, strengthening energy security, and fostering a cleaner future.\" Having the production capacity of over 8,500 tonnes per annum of green hydrogen and its derivatives under development across six projects, Jakson Green is uniquely positioned to spearhead India's clean energy transition and contribute to a sustainable future, it said.",

    "description": "Besides building solar parks to produce electricity from sunlight and wind farms that do the same from wind, the conglomerate is building major facilities to manufacture electrolyzers for making green hydrogen, wind power turbines and solar panels.Adani Group to invest $100 billion in energy transition: Gautam AdaniRelated stories",
    "content": "Adani group will invest more than USD 100 billion (around Rs 835 crore) in energy transition projects and manufacturing capability to produce every major component required for green energy generation, its chairman said on Wednesday. Besides building solar parks to produce electricity from sunlight and wind farms that do the same from wind, the conglomerate is building major facilities to manufacture electrolyzers for making green hydrogen, wind power turbines and solar panels. Green hydrogen, which is made by splitting hydrogen from water with the help of electrolyzers powered by clean energy, is seen as a potential panacea for decarbonizing the industry as well as transportation. \"The next decade will see us invest more than USD 100 billion in the energy transition space and further expand our integrated renewable energy value chain that today already spans the manufacturing of every major component required for green energy generation,\" he said. The coal-to-ports group wants to produce the \"world's least expensive green electron\" that will become the feedstock for several sectors that must meet the sustainability mandate. \"And to make this happen, we are already building the world's largest single-site renewable energy park in Khavda, in the district of Kutch (in Gujarat). Just this single location will generate 30 GW of power, thereby taking our total renewable energy capacity to 50 GW by 2030,\" he said. Adani said the energy transition space will fundamentally change the global energy landscape forever. \"The global transition market was valued at approximately USD 3 trillion in 2023 and is expected to grow to nearly USD 6 trillion by 2030, and thereafter double every 10 years till 2050.\" \"As many of you know, in the case of India, our country aims to install 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. This ambitious target will require annual investments of over USD 150 billion dollars. The transition to green energy in India is expected to generate millions of new jobs in sectors such as solar and wind, energy storage, hydrogen and its derivatives, EV charging stations, as well as grid infrastructure development,\" he said. On digital infrastructure, he said data is indeed the new oil and at the heart of all the action is the Data Centre - the critical infrastructure needed to power all forms of computational needs, especially AI workloads for machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning. All of this is dependent on the ability to process data at an unprecedented speed and scale which are the precise capabilities that data centres provide. However, this will need massive amounts of energy, making the data centre business the largest energy consuming industry in the world, he said. \"This makes the energy transition even more complex and is raising electricity prices, thereby adding to the already high prices because of the combined impact of climate change and demand growth,\" Adani said. The billionaire said the infrastructure required for energy transition and the infrastructure required for digital transformation are now inseparable as the technology sector becomes the largest consumer of the precious green electrons. Adani group's digital footprint will span industrial clouds across each of its businesses that it will productize and then take to market, operational technology cybersecurity offerings, super apps to leverage its B2C businesses across wide variety of consumer facing businesses, Artificial Intelligence labs to capitalize on India's fast emerging expertise to provide AI services to the world, and Data Centres that will form the backbone of the energy intensive digital revolution. \"In fact, it is anticipated that by the year 2030, the world will need 100 to 150 GW of additional green energy just for the AI data centres. We already have India's largest order book for data centres and are now in discussions for additional gigawatt-scale green AI data centres which we are uniquely positioned to deliver,\" he said.",

In addition to Embraer's home country Brazil, nations such as Portugal, Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, the Czech Republic and South Korea have selected the planemaker's military transportation aircraft. Expanding its presence abroad with more C-390 sales has been a key goal of Embraer's defense division, which also sees Sweden as a potential customer. It has partnerships with Mahindra in India and Saab in Sweden to introduce the plane. Embraer has also been \"aggressive on several fronts\" in the United States, Costa Junior said, including exploring opportunities for mergers or acquisitions as well as pitching the C-390 to the U.S. Marines, Air Force and special forces. \"We do believe that the C-390 could add additional value to those entities in the U.S.,\" the executive said. \"One thing is clear to us: We would like to become a partner of the U.S. government.\" Asked if any potential relationship with China could compromise connections with the U.S., Costa Junior stressed that Embraer's defense business had no relationship or any kind of discussions with the Asian superpower. \"We are 100% U.S.- and NATO-oriented,\" he said.",

    "content": "India has become the largest market for Nestle globally for its instant noodles and soup brand Maggi and the second largest for chocolate wafer brand KitKat, according to the latest annual report of its local subsidiary. Besides, the India market with a high double-digit growth has become one of the fastest growing markets for Nestle, it added. \"Penetration, premiumisation and innovation, combined with disciplined resource allocation, have been key in driving business, making your company one of the fastest growing markets for Nestle globally,\" said Nestle India's annual report for 2023-24. Nestle is expanding its play under brand Maggi and has launched Oats Noodle, Korean Noodles and various masala variants at an affordable Rs 10. \"The Prepared Dishes and Cooking Aids business recorded a strong growth momentum. This was aided by a balance of product mix, pricing and volume growth in Maggi noodles and Maggi Masala-ae-Magic, supported by strong consumer engagement and market presence with media campaigns and attractive consumer activations,\" it said. In confectionary, Nestle India said it sold 4,200 million fingers of KitKat. The growth was fuelled by the launch of new products, expansion of the distribution network and innovative brand activations. \"KitKat has emerged as the star performer, by not only delivering strong growth but making NestlÃ© India the second largest market for the brand globally,\" it said. In India, brand Maggi recovered after a five-month ban on its instant noodles over allegation of containing lead beyond permissible limits. However, the instant noodles returned to market after a relaunch in November 2015 and later Nestle India extended the brand in the food segment and adjacencies. Before the crisis, the brand had over 70 per cent market share in the instant noodles segment, which it still has not reached as the competition has intensified in the segment with arrival of new players. Nestle, which is setting up its tenth Indian factory in Odisha, reaffirmed the significance of India as a market. \"Strengthening this further, your company is poised to invest approximately Rs 7,500 crore between 2020 and 2025 to develop new capabilities and expand existing ones with a sharp focus on sustained growth and innovation,\" its Chairman \u0026 Managing Director Suresh Narayanan said while addressing shareholders in the report. The company is focussing on innovations and in the past eight years, it has launched over 140 products. A significant portion of sales in 2023 was attributed to innovative products. According to Narayanan, plant-based products present a significant opportunity for Nestle India, which has been operating here for 112 years. It is also expanding its presence and through RUrban journey its direct coverage has gone beyond two lakh villages. Nestle India recently announced to continue to pay royalty to its parent company at the existing rate of 4.5 per cent of net sales after a proposal to hike it was rejected by shareholders. The company's board approved the continuation of payment of general licence fees (royalty) at the rate of 4.5 per cent to Societe des Produits Nestle SA (licensor) and recommended to the members of the company for their approval. In April, Nestle India's board had approved increasing royalty to its parent company by 0.15 per cent per year for the next five years, thereby enhancing it to 5.25 per cent of net sales. In its annual report, Nestle India said \"the general licence fees (royalty) rate paid by the company to the licensor is comparatively lower\" in comparison to other multinational corporations (MNCs) in India. Nestle India had reported sales of Rs 24,275.5 crore in the fifteen months to March 31, 2024.",

    "content": "HSBC Holdings Plc has executed nearly half the volume of bond-derivative trades in India’s international finance hub over the last month, ahead of the sovereign bonds’ inclusion in a key global index. The British bank, via its unit in the International Financial Services Centres Authority, carried out the so-called total return swap deals worth more than $250 million with foreign investors who want onshore bond exposure, its head of India markets said. That compares with a total volume of about $510 million. The total-return swaps have emerged as one of the key products for foreigners to get India exposure without necessarily having to get a license to buy the bonds onshore and deal with local regulations. Foreign investors have been piling into Indian sovereign bonds ahead of their inclusion into JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co.’s emerging-market index from June 28. Standard Chartered Plc offers a similar derivative product. About three to four foreign banks have written the offshore derivatives so far, K. Rajaraman, chairman of the International Financial Services Centres Authority, said. “This year we are seeing a lot of traction, especially after the inclusion of India in the bond indices,” he said. About $10 billion of inflows have come into India’s index-eligible bonds since JPMorgan announced in September that it will include the nation’s bonds in its flagship index. Some funds are using other alternatives like investing in rupee-denominated supranational bonds or in an India bond exchange-traded fund like those offered by BlackRock Inc. or Legal \u0026 General Investment Management to get India exposure.",

    "content": "Hyundai Motor India Ltd plans to launch four electric vehicle models in future, including Creta EV, in the last quarter of the current fiscal, according to the company's preliminary IPO papers filed with Sebi. The company is looking to maximise the price competitiveness of its electric vehicle (EV) models and intends to focus on securing local production capabilities for key parts, such as cells, battery packs, power electronics, and drivetrain and building a localised EV supply chain. In the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL) said it seeks to calibrate its EV strategy and plan EV timelines in line with market demands in India by launching the appropriate EV models within each price segment. At present, HMIL sells two EV models in India -- IONIQ5 and Kona Electric -- priced around Rs 45 lakh and Rs 24 lakh, respectively. The company further said, \"To maximise price competitiveness of our EV models, we intend to focus on securing local production capabilities for key parts, such as cells, battery packs, power electronics, drivetrain and building a localised EV supply chain\". HMIL has leased a section of the Chennai Manufacturing Plant to Mobis, a Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) group firm, for the assembly of EV batteries, which will be supplied to the company, in turn, reducing import costs for battery packs, it added. \"Further, we intend to localise the EV supply chain through collaboration with both local and global EV power electronic vendors,\" it said, adding recently in 2024, HMC announced a strategic collaboration with Exide Energy Solutions Ltd to facilitate localised battery production and supply in India. Similarly, HMIL said, \"Currently, our company is also exploring different avenues for a strategic collaboration for the production of batteries. We believe the addition of domestically sourced EV models will contribute to diversifying our passenger vehicle offering and further expand our market coverage\". Further, in the near term, the company aims to increase localisation to secure production-linked incentive (PLI) subsidies and transition to a dedicated EV platform to optimise costs, it added. Beyond EV manufacturing, HMIL said, \"We aim to develop the EV infrastructure in India by constructing charging stations. As of March 31, 2024, we have established 11 fast charging stations in India. We intend to support the adoption of EVs by installing charging points across cities and highways in India\". Pointing out threats and challenges to the automotive industry in its DRHP, the company pointed out 'ad-hoc changes in policies' as one of the factors. \"Another challenge that the industry is facing is frequent changes in policies, which makes it difficult for the auto industry stakeholders not only to ensure adherence but also commit investments. Overall policy stability and transparency will be required going forward to ensure smooth technology transition and localisation in the country,\" HMIL said. Further, it also pointed out that there are still concerns about meeting the eligibility criteria and availing of the benefits under the localisation norms. The government is encouraging localisation across sectors, especially in the automotive sector via policies like PLI for automotive technology and advanced cell chemistry, phased manufacturing program, 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' and Make in India, it said. \"While the end goal of localisation is to reduce import dependence, and bring down overall manufacturing costs, it also involves significant initial capital investments from several stakeholders within the automotive industry,\" HMIL said in its preliminary papers. The company further said, \"While the government has designed the schemes to support investments by offering several subsidies and import duty benefits, there are still concerns around meeting the eligibility criteria and availing of the benefits\". Going forward, it said, \"Simplification and better tracking of the policies will ensure localisation in India. The progress of the vendors tied up with individual OEMs would also lead to a change in the risk profile of the industry from a supply-side perspective\". Last week, HMIL filed preliminary papers with Sebi to launch an initial public offering (IPO). The company's IPO, if it goes through, would be the largest in India, surpassing LIC's share sale of Rs 21,000 crore. It proposes to sell 14,21,94,700 equity shares of face value of Rs 10 each, which constitute 17.5 per cent of the post-offer paid-up share capital of the company.",

    "content": "Fitch Ratings on Tuesday raised India's growth forecast for current fiscal to 7.2 per cent, from 7 per cent projected in March, citing a recovery in consumer spending and increased investment. For the fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27, Fitch projected growth rates of 6.5 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively. \"We expect the Indian economy to expand by a strong 7.2 per cent in FY24/25 (an upward revision of 0.2 pp from the March GEO),\" Fitch said in its global economic outlook report. Investment will continue to rise but more slowly than in recent quarters, while consumer spending will recover with elevated consumer confidence, it said. Fitch said purchasing managers survey data point to continued growth at the start of the current financial year. It said signs of the coming monsoon season being more normal should support growth and make inflation less volatile, though a recent heatwave poses a risk. \"We expect growth in later years to slow and approach our medium-term trend estimate,\" it said, adding growth will be driven by consumer spending and investment. The Indian economy grew 8.2 per cent in the last fiscal (2023-24), with a 7.8 per cent expansion in March quarter. Inflation, Fitch expects, will decline to 4.5 per cent by end 2024 and average 4.3 per cent in 2025 and 2026. Fitch said it expects the RBI to cut policy interest rates by 25 basis points this year to 6.25 per cent.",

We will be happy to grow at this pace,\" he said. \"And we have some elbow room available in terms of excess SLR and which ensures that we don't have any pressure on us to raise the deposit rates for supporting our loan-to-deposit ratio,\" he said. The bank has an excess Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) between Rs 3.5 lakh crore and Rs 4 lakh crore. \"Incidentally, I may add here that our loan-to-deposit ratio is around 68-69 per cent only. That leaves enough room for us to lend without having pressure on the deposit interest rates. Nevertheless, he said, \"We always give importance to deposits. That is the reason why we increased the interest rate for the short-term deposits recently because we felt that there's room for improvement...we should improve our deposit growth rate to some extent during this year. And our effort would be that we should at least grow around 12-13 per cent this year.\" Last month, SBI hiked the fixed deposit rate on select short-term maturity up to 75 basis points. For retail term deposits of 46-179 days, the rate increased by 75 basis points to 5.50 per cent against the earlier 4.75 per cent. Asked about the Net Interest Margin (NIM) outlook for the current financial year, Khara expressed hope and said it would be around the same level recorded in FY24 or could be 2-3 basis points movement here or there. The domestic NIM of the bank stood at 3.43 per cent for FY24 down by 15 basis points (bps) while the whole bank NIM stood at 3.28 per cent lower by 9 bps year-on-year basis. The rise in both rupee liquidity and dollar liquidity cost due to tight monetary policy pursued by central banks across the globe was a major factor affecting NIM during FY24. As far as Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) are concerned, Khara said, \"We should have a downward trajectory both for net and gross. However, it is very difficult to make any projections as it is also a function of the macroeconomy.\" The bank is trying to insulate its book for macro stress nevertheless it's difficult to give any kind of guidance on NPAs. \"Our guidance as far as our credit cost is concerned, we have kept it at 0.50 per cent but our effort is to keep it at the level of 0.29 per cent,\" he added. Gross NPA of SBI declined to 2.24 per cent, an improvement of 54 bps compared to previous FY23 while the net NPA stood at 0.57 per cent, an improvement of 10 bps YoY. The credit cost also fell by 3 bps to 0.29 per cent at the end of FY24.",

    "content": "Food delivery giant Zomato on June 16 clarified through a communication to the exchanges that it is in discussion to acquire Paytm's movie ticketing and events business. The clarification came after media reports said negotiations over a Rs 1,500-crore deal between One97 Communications Ltd, the parent company of Paytm, and Zomato were in advanced stages. \"We acknowledge that we are in discussions with Paytm for the transaction, however, no binding decision has been taken at this stage that would warrant a Board approval and subsequent disclosure in accordance with applicable law,\" Zomato said in the statement. Zomato's interest in Paytm’s events and movie ticketing business is a strategic fit, complementing its broader aim to capture consumer demand across various categories, including food, grocery, and entertainment. A successful sale would enable Paytm to concentrate on travel, deals, and cashback—sectors crucial for expanding its merchant base and boosting overall sales.

    "content": "Lone ranger Desi Soros (DS) is known for boldly venturing into stocks that most fund managers would think twice before buying. Probably it has to do with DS’s philosophy that maximum money can be made in unloved stocks. Sun TV is the latest among such stocks that DS has taken a fancy to. His schemes picked up around 6.4 million shares of the South-based broadcaster last month when arbitrage funds were reversing their trades in that stock. Domestic mutual fund holdings in the stock have risen in the last couple of quarters, but opinion is divided on whether the stock will get rerated considering the promoters' roughshod treatment of institutional investors in the past. But then, it is usually the case that when prices rise beyond a certain point, fund managers have shown themselves to be willing to forgive the sins of the past. DS too may be betting on that.  TCNS Clothing's shares have seen a spike in trading volumes over the last couple of trading sessions. Mauritius-based TA FDI Investors has been trimming its exposure to the stock and a good chunk of those shares have been picked up the HNI from the royal state who has built a reputation for himself over the years as a skilled special situations investor. This is causing players to wonder if there might be a special situation brewing in TCNS. The company has been making losses for the last four years now. Earlier this year, the royal investor had a stroke of luck when he managed to exit the TFCI stock in the nick of time. Investors who bought TFCI shares from the royal investor, however, were not as lucky. Silent buyers Madison India Opportunities Trust Fund sold 11.35 lakh shares of India Shelter Finance Corp on Thursday. The BSE bulk deal window does not mention any of the buyers. Considering that domestic mutual funds have sizeable exposure to the stock, it is likely that the block may have been picked up a clutch of other mutual funds. India Shelter had hit a record high in February this year but fell as sharply during the midcap meltdown in March. It now appears to be making a comeback. Poonawala Fincorp MD’s Ajay Bhutada’s sale of 76 lakh shares is learnt to have been picked up by a clutch of HNIs. The stock is quoting around 4 times book, and despite the action in the stock over the last year, domestic funds have not shown any interest so far. If the latest buyers are counting on a rerating, it will have to driven by another set of equally optimistic HNIs, it seems. Uncomfortable similarities Defence stocks are as much a rage on the bourses right now as IT stocks were back during the heydays of the dotcom boom in 2000. But there is another unsavoury similarity between the two sectors, especially when it comes to the lesser-known companies, is the chatter on the Street. Like some of the IT companies back then were actually money-laundering machines, export orders being claimed by some of the so-called ‘defence’ companies exist only on the bills of lading.",

    "content": "A joint venture between Reliance Industries' Jio Platforms and Luxembourg-based SES to provide gigabit fibre internet has won approval from the Indian space regulator to operate satellites there, a government executive said. The three approvals issued to Orbit Connect India - which aims to provide satellite-based high-speed internet access - come as companies from Amazon.com to Elon Musk's Starlink have been vying for the go-ahead to launch satellite communication services in the world's most populous nation. The authorisations have not been previously reported. They were granted in April and June from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre, known as IN-SPACe. These allow Orbit Connect to operate satellites above India, but further approvals are needed by the country's department of telecoms to begin operations. Inmarsat, another company hoping to provide high-speed satellite-based internet, has also gotten approval to operate satellites over India, IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka told Reuters. Two other companies, Elon Musk's Starlink and Amazon.com's Kuiper, have applied. Eutelsat's Bharti Enterprises-backed OneWeb was given all of its approvals late last year. India's satellite broadband service market is expected to grow 36% per year over the next five years and reach $1.9 billion by 2030, according to the consultancy Deloitte. Globally, the race to connect rural areas of the world via space-based internet is accelerating. Amazon plans to invest $10 billion in Kuiper, which was announced in 2019, the year SpaceX began deploying its first operational Starlink satellites. Last week, Sri Lanka gave Starlink preliminary approval to provide internet services there. Goenka said the more companies were involved in the sector in India, the better off consumers would be. \"Comparatively low pricing of communication services in India will compel global players to drive innovation to reduce their pricing,\" said Goenka, the former managing director of automaker Mahindra \u0026 Mahindra. \"This is already being done in many industries like automotive, where multinational OEMs had to innovate to meet the expectations of Indian consumers of high performance and low cost.\" IN-SPACe will also soon authorise private companies to operate ground stations, he said, which would enable satellite operators to download data as they pass over India. Prime Minister Modi's government, which just won a rare third term, has been pushing the development of India's space industry. This year, it opened the gates for foreign direct investment in the sector, saying outside companies could invest in the manufacture of components and systems or sub-systems for satellites up to 100% without approval. As a result, investors' interest has \"significantly increased\", Goenka said. \"Last year investments into private companies were $2 million-$7 million. This year they are talking $20 million-$30 million,\" he said. \"The proof of concept has happened.\" Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.",

    "content": "India's consumer market represents a long-term structural opportunity, driven by population, a growing middle class, rapid urbanisation, increasing disposable incomes and raising aspirations, Tata Consumer Products Ltd Chairman N Chandrasekaran said on Thursday. The Tata group's FMCG arm is well positioned to capitalise on the significant opportunity, he said, while addressing the annual general meeting (AGM) of TCPL. Chandrasekaran said the India economy has been growing \"very strongly\" and the current momentum continues to be high. The baseline forecast for the world economy is to continue to grow over 3 per cent during 2024 and 2025. However, \"India has been growing very strongly with the economic growth rate of 8.2 per cent for the fiscal 2023-2044. Looking at the future, the momentum continues to be high and India should maintain similar growth momentum in the coming years,\" said Chandrasekaran. Notably, India's consumer market represents a \"long-term structural\" opportunity, Chandrasekaran said and noted that this is driven by a young population, a growing middle class, rapid urbanisation, increasing disposable incomes, and raising aspirations. Chandrasekaran also added that the Indian middle class is growing rapidly, which will create opportunities for the company. \"India's middle class is expected to grow from about 30 per cent of the population to 50 per cent by the end of this decade. That is about an additional 300 million people who will be entering the middle class,\" he said. Apart from this, rapid urbanisation, increasing disposable incomes and ever increasing aspirations of consumers, all bode well for Tata Consumer Products Ltd (TCPL), which is well positioned to capitalise on the significant opportunity. Over the latest acquisition of Capital Foods and Organic India by TCPL, Chandrasekaran said, this is to expand the company's addressable market into high-growth, high-margin segments. \"The company has scaled its distribution to reach 4 million retail outlets in India, which represents a two-fold increase since 2020. The company has also focused on innovation and has replaced a 5x growth in innovation revenue since the fiscal year FY21,\" he said. TCPL, new innovations contributes 5 per cent to sales distribution, which is in line with the best metrics in the industry. \"The company's digital transformation agenda has been progressing well,\" he said. On Tata Starbucks, its 50:50 JV with Starbuck, he said it has opened 95 new stores in FY24, setting a record for the highest number of stores opened in a single year since inception. \"The company's international business has been progressing well,\" he said. In FY24, TCPL delivered revenue of Rs 15,206 crores, with a growth of 10 per cent. TCPL was formed in 2020, after merging the consumer products business of Tata Chemicals with Tata Global Beverages. It owns brands as -- Tata Salt, Tata Tea, Tetley, Eight O'Clock Coffee, Good Earth Tea, and Tata Sampann. It also operates coffee chain Tata Starbucks.",

    "content": "Jaypee Infratech Ltd, which is now being controlled by Mumbai-based Suraksha Group, has appointed Devang Pravin Patel as its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and will also delist its shares from stock exchanges. The appointment has been made with effect from June 8, 2024, according to a recent regulatory filing. Suraksha Group, which has taken control of Jaypee Infratech ltd (JIL) after approval from the appellate tribunal NCLAT last month, will delist JIL from stock exchanges. However, the shares issued to Suraksha Group (Successful Resolution Applicant) in terms of the approved resolution plan will not be extinguished. Suraksha Group has infused Rs 125 crore equity fund in JIL, as part of its resolution plan to settle banks' dues and complete 20,000 unfinished flats across various projects in Delhi-NCR. Earlier this month, Mumbai-based Suraksha Group took control of JIL by constituting a three-member board. The takeover followed the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) decision on May 24, upholding Suraksha Group's bid to acquire JIL. The NCLAT had directed Suraksha Group to pay an additional Rs 1,334 crore to Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) as farmers' compensation. Sudhir V Valia, promoter of Suraksha Group, has been appointed as a Non Executive Director on the JIL board. Aalok Champak Dave has been appointed as Executive Director and Usha Anil Kadam as independent director. Upholding the National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) decision of March 2023, the NCLAT on May 24 had said the decision was made to avoid any further delay in the implementation of the resolution plan and also to take care of the interests of all stakeholders, including home buyers and claim of YEIDA for additional compensation of the farmers. The corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against JIL was started in August 2017, over an application by the IDBI Bank-led consortium. On March 7 last year, the NCLT approved the bid of the Suraksha groupto buy JIL. However, many parties, including YEIDA, filed petitions in the NCLAT to challenge the NCLT order. In its final resolution plan, the Suraksha group offered to bankers more than 2,500 acres of land and nearly Rs 1,300 crore by way of issuing non-convertible debentures. It also proposed to complete all stalled projects over the next four years. Lenders of Jaypee Infratech had submitted a claim of Rs 9,783 crore. In the fourth round of the bidding process to find a buyer for the JIL in 2021, the Suraksha group won the bid with 98.66 per cent votes. As many as 12 banks and more than 20,000 homebuyers had voting rights in the Committee of Creditors (CoC). The company had got 0.12 per cent more votes than state-owned NBCC, which was also in the fray. In the first round of insolvency proceedings in 2018, the Rs 7,350 crore bid of Lakshadweep, part of the Suraksha group, was rejected by the lenders. The CoC had rejected the bids of Suraksha and NBCC in the second round held in May-June 2019. In November 2019, the Supreme Court directed that the revised bids be invited only from NBCC and Suraksha. Then, in December 2019, the CoC approved the resolution plan of NBCC during the third round of the bidding process. In March 2020, NBCC got approval from the NCLT to acquire JIL. However, the order was challenged before the NCLAT and later in the Supreme Court. On March 21, 2021, the apex court ordered a fresh round of bidding between NBCC and Suraksha Group only. In this fourth round, Suraksha Group won the bid.",

On March 7 last year, the NCLT approved the bid of the Mumbai-based Suraksha group to buy JIL. However, many parties, including YEIDA, filed a petition in the NCLAT challenging the NCLT order. In its final resolution plan, the Suraksha group offered to bankers more than 2,500 acres of land and nearly Rs 1,300 crore by way of issuing non-convertible debentures. It also proposed to complete all stalled projects over the next four years. Lenders of Jaypee Infratech had submitted a claim of Rs 9,783 crore. In the fourth round of the bidding process to find a buyer for JIL in 2021, the Suraksha group won the bid with 98.66 per cent votes. As many as 12 banks and more than 20,000 homebuyers had voting rights in the Committee of Creditors (CoC). The company had got 0.12 per cent more votes than state-owned NBCC, which was also in the fray. In the first round of insolvency proceedings in 2018, the Rs 7,350 crore bid of Lakshadweep, part of the Suraksha group, was rejected by the lenders. The CoC had rejected the bids of Suraksha and NBCC in the second round held in May-June 2019. In November 2019, the Supreme Court directed that the revised bids be invited only from NBCC and Suraksha. Then, in December 2019, the CoC approved the resolution plan of NBCC during the third round of the bidding process. In March 2020, NBCC got approval from the NCLT to acquire JIL. However, the order was challenged before the NCLAT and later in the Supreme Court. On March 21, 2021, the apex court ordered a fresh round of bidding between NBCC and Suraksha Group only. In this fourth round, Suraksha Group won the bid.",

    "content": "Twin engine supply Interglobe Aviation’s ex-promoter Rakesh Gangwal periodically selling part of his stake has been a source of edginess for bulls in the stock. But when the current promoter also joins the spree, bulls now have more reason to look over their shoulder. The outlook for the sector may be rosy, but technical factors also have a role to play in stock price moves. Some big guns of Dalal Street had loaded up on the stock over the last few months. Having taken the stock to cruising altitude, they trimmed their positions just before the latest block deal.  Foreign high trading frequency (HFT) firms may boast of cutting edge technology, but on most days they are no match for the Fastest Finger First (FFF) proprietary broker which manages to squeeze itself into most block deals ahead of buyers who had negotiated the deal. FFF, along with its sister firm is said to have made a killing in the IRB block deal on Tuesday, making a spread of as much as Rs 2 on a huge of volume of shares. Foreign firms may have the technology, but on Dalal Street, ‘native intelligence’ is much more effective A rich harvest Shares of TIL (erstwhile Tractors India Limited) have been on a tear over the last month. One reason for this, players tracking the stock say, is that the rights issue's shares have not yet been credited to shareholders demat accounts, despite the issue having closed on May 10. That once again raises the question that many on Dalal Street have been asking: if there is a defined timeline for the IPO process, why is there not a similar standard timeline for allotment of shares in rights issues. Is Sebi listening? One-way street Oriana Power ranks among the rare instances of IPO where the promoter made a generous gift to investors. The IPO priced at Rs 118 has appreciated 23 times (yes, that’s right) in just 10 months. Maybe the market knows the worth of the company better than the promoter. It helps that anything to do with solar is enjoying the same status in this market that IT firms enjoyed during the 2000 tech boom, and infra companies during the 2008 boom. Exchange filings do not show any major order wins. But social media handles and Telegram channels are all singing the same tune: that Oriana is a mutibagger in the making because of the boom in solar energy. A little too synchronized for comfort, one could say. Disappearing act The Street simply can’t get enough of Wardwizard Innovations \u0026 Mobility ever since the company announced a $1.29 billion order win (or MoU, it is still not clear) a few days back. And it now also looks like promoters are being kind to investors by offering up their (the promoters that is) shares. In the last three trading sessions of May, some promoter group entities had sold 1.5 million shares. They stepped up the selling on Monday and Tuesday, dumping another 8.1 million shares. Clearly, they are not as kicked up about the order as the Street is.",

    "content": "A federal judge moved to untangle the complex bankruptcy case of a Byju’s unit by offering to rule out the arrest of a Florida hedge fund manager if he helps locate $533 million that the Indian tech company allegedly tried to hide. US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey, during a court hearing Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware, agreed to drop an arrest order for William C. Morton, the founder of Camshaft Fund. Byju’s invested $533 million of loan proceeds with the fund last year, according to court records. The money was later moved to a UK lender and then to an unnamed, non-US entity affiliated with Byju’s. Lenders are trying to use the bankruptcy case of a Byju’s unit based in the US to recover the cash. “We need to move this case forward somehow,” Dorsey said. The missing money is at the heart of a dispute between lenders owed $1.2 billion and the startup founded by entrepreneur Byju Raveendran. The education-tech company’s official name is Think \u0026 Learn Pvt. The cash belongs to a bankrupt shell company, Byju’s Alpha Inc., which is affiliated with Think \u0026 Learn and was taken over by the lenders after their loan defaulted. Morton’s attorney, Pieter Van Tol, told Dorsey on Tuesday that the money manager, who is in his 20s, is willing to answer questions under oath and cooperate with lenders. Morton had previously refused to speak with lenders in Miami, where his hedge fund is based, “because of fear of arrest,” Van Tol said in court. Van Tol declined to comment further after the hearing.

Hinduja scion in Swiss human-trafficking trial says Nanny was like a ‘Second Mum’ to familyRelated stories",
    "content": "The scion of the billionaire Hinduja family rejected allegations he overworked an Indian nanny at his Swiss villa, saying it would’ve been idiotic to do so when she was like a “second mum” to his kids. Ajay Hinduja was testifying on the first day of the Geneva trial of a branch of one of India’s most prominent families, which stands accused of human trafficking and overworking household staff. Ajay Hinduja, his wife Namrata and parents Prakash and Kamal were all indicted last year by Geneva prosecutors for allegedly making their staff work up to 18-hour days without a day off at their villa overlooking Lake Geneva. “I am shocked that someone who we considered to be a second mum for our children, could accuse us of something as demeaning as human trafficking,” he said later in the hearing, testifying mainly in French. He said he wanted to thank the woman for her work for the family, adding that she’s still in touch with his kids and sends them Diwali greetings by phone. The family confiscated their staff’s passports and put to them work on short-term tourist visas repeatedly obtained on false pretenses, prosecutors say. Ajay Hinduja rejected that accusation and said the employees had contracts endorsed by the Swiss embassy in India and their visas were regularly renewed by Geneva cantonal authorities. Judge Sabina Mascotto immediately rebutted that characterization of events, saying checks showed the staff lacked the correct Swiss paperwork. Instead they only ever had French-issued, Schengen-zone visas, referring to the European travel area, which allows people to move without passport checks. Ajay Hinduja said his staff were allowed to come and go from the house as they pleased provided at least one of them was home at all times for security reasons. Asked about their salaries, which prosecutors say never amounted to more than a few hundred Swiss francs a month — a fraction of local wages — he said it was the Hinduja Group’s HR department that did all hiring and contracts, not him. On Monday evening, he said his lawyers and those for the three plaintiffs were “close” to reaching a deal that would see the staff withdraw their complaints. But even if an accord is reached, it should still mean the criminal trial will proceed. That all the staff recruitment was done from India was a consistent refrain from the 56-year-old, who sits on the board of the Hinduja Group, one of India’s largest conglomerates. ‘Regret’His one regret, he testified, was that he didn’t get more involved in the running of the household after his parents were convicted of minor infractions, after being denounced at an employment tribunal in 2006. “I regret not having analyzed the situation more closely,” he said, in part because he was so busy with his own work. “I had confidence” in our legal advisers, he said. The trial only got underway Monday after the Hindujas secured a postponement, citing the inability of the parents to travel because of poor health. The lawyers then sought to have the judge recused, citing alleged bias, and to have the case sent back for re-examination. Both requests were rejected.",

    "description": "The company's share in the train online travel aggregator (OTA) market is at 52 percent as of nine months FY24 whereas its flights and bus market share at 5.3 percent and 12.9 percent respectively. Ixigo focuses on growing air travel market. Related stories",
    "content": "Travel tech company Ixigo has stepped up its focus on a wider share of the air travel pie and looks to tap into the next billion users betting big on capacity addition. The simmering air fares will stabilise and cool off at some point with capacity additions, Aloke Bajpai, chairman, managing director and group chief executive officer of the company, told Moneycontrol. \"If you think from where the next 50 million new flyers are going to come from then a lot of them will be train passengers travelling in the second and third AC trains. A lower air fare will lead to more shift in passengers from trains to flights. Because we are a market where only 4 percent people fly and take multiple trips and that's how we get 150 million passengers in a year. Compared to most other economies we are still underpenetrated on the air side. Ixigo needs to ride on that and tap into the next billion users,\" he said. \"We are at a low market share (in air), so we are pushing the pedal there to accelerate growth,\" Bajpai said. The Indian air travel market is one of the fastest growing markets in the world, with total passengers handled across airports amounting to 32.7 crore passengers in FY23, according to Ixigo's red herring prospectus (RHP). The initial public offering of Le Travenues Technology, the parent company of travel aggregator Ixigo, will hit Dalal Street on June 10. India's current air travel market is estimated to be 4 percent lesser that pre-Covid numbers. In FY20, 14.1 crore Indian travellers took to the skies to fulfil their domestic travel needs and in FY23 this number reached 13.8 crore, as per the RHP. Bajpai expects capacity addition to accelerate in the coming few years. \"Over 1,000 aircrafts are on order so, we are looking at market size tripling once all of that (inventory) comes in. The industry is hoping the new inventory starts coming from the second half of this year (FY25). The airlines are guiding the same. Indigo said they will add one aircraft every week, Air India is also seeing some deliveries coming in. These are positive signs,\" he said. Both Indigo and Air India have placed landmark plane orders with aircraft manufacturers recently, with Indigo placing an order of 500 aircraft in June 2023. This 500 aircraft order is not only IndiGo’s largest order, but also the largest-ever single aircraft purchase by any airline with Airbus. Air India has also firmed up its order for 250 Airbus aircraft and 220 new Boeing planes in June 2023. The Air India order includes 70 widebody planes, comprising 34 A350-1000s and six A350-900s from Airbus, and 20 787 Dreamliners and 10 777Xs from Boeing. It also includes 140 Airbus A320neo, 70 Airbus A321neo and 190 Boeing 737 MAX narrow body aircraft. Air India has also signed options to buy an additional 70 planes from Boeing including 50 737 MAXs and 20 787 Dreamliners. The delivery of these planes is expected to happen over the next five years. The growth in new airplane deliveries is a key driver, with the Indian fleet expected to be 1,200 aircrafts by 2027. However, on capacity additions, Bajpai pointed out that a lot depends on Boeing and Airbus being able to deliver aircrafts in a timely fashion. \"We recently got to know about China’s embargo on the supply part. So, we don't know how that will affect things.\" China in May had said it will restrict the exports of certain aviation and aerospace components and technologies starting July 1, citing the need to safeguard national security.",

India is one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and both domestic and international traffic are on the rise. India's domestic air traffic is expected to rise 6-8 per cent to 161 to 164 million in the current financial year, while international air traffic is projected to jump 9-11 per cent to 75 to 78 million in the current fiscal, aviation advisory firm CAPA India said on Wednesday.",

    "content": "Paytm’s share of the unified payments interface (UPI) market in India fell for a fourth straight month as the fintech pioneer struggles to recover from a regulatory setback. Paytm accounted for 8.1% of total UPI transactions in May, down from 13% in January, according to data released by the National Payments Corporation of India. The company was rocked in January when the Reserve Bank of India ordered Paytm Payments Bank Ltd., a banking affiliate, to wind down operations. Its shares have fallen about 55% since then.  Operated by state-backed NPCI, UPI is a system that allows users to make instant money transfers by linking banks with fintech apps such as Paytm, PhonePe and Google Pay. The UPI network processed a record 14.04 billion transactions in May, up 5.5% month-on-month. Walmart Inc.-owned PhonePe maintained its dominant position in the market with a 49% share in May, while Alphabet’s Google Pay boasted a 37% share.  Since the RBI order, Sharma has moved to steady the ship through new partnerships with some of India’s top lenders including Axis Bank Ltd., HDFC Bank Ltd. and State Bank of India Ltd. The alliances will help Paytm with instant money transfers that used to be handled by its banking affiliate. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment from Bloomberg News. “We expect near-term financial impact to our revenue and profitability, due to disruptions faced in our business in Q4,” Sharma said in Paytm’s latest earnings filing.",

    "content": "ReNew Energy Global Plc on Thursday said its net profit jumped seven-fold to USD 7 million in the January-March quarter of FY24 due to higher income and reduced expenses. The total revenue for the latest fourth quarter decreased by 4.4 per cent to USD 297 million, down from USD 311 million in the same period in the preceding fiscal, according to a company statement. The company attributed the fall in revenue to lower earnings from its transmission projects. The clean energy major registered an 8.1 per cent jump in its total revenue to USD 1,158 million in FY24 from USD 1,072 million in FY23. The company said that the record profits were registered despite a marginal fall in the weighted average Plant Load Factor (PLF) for the reporting quarter as well as the financial year due to lower radiation and wind speeds. While the PLF for FY24 was 26.4 per cent for wind assets, compared to 25.5 per cent for FY23, the PLF for solar assets for FY24 was 24.6 per cent compared to 24.8 per cent for FY23.

Byju’s creditors petition to put more units in US bankruptcyRelated stories",
    "content": "A group of lenders asked a court to impose bankruptcy oversight on multiple units tied to the struggling Indian education technology company Byju’s, claiming millions of dollars are being “siphoned” out of the companies. Creditors led by HPS Investment Partners filed involuntary Chapter 11 cases in Delaware against Neuron Fuel Inc., Epic! Creations Inc. and Tangible Play Inc. on Wednesday. All three were once affiliated with Byju’s Alpha, a unit of the once high-flying startup that was put into bankruptcy earlier this year after defaulting on $1.2 billion of debt. The lenders accused firm’s eponymous founder Byju Raveendran of violating their debt contracts by refusing to give them financial details about the three units, which are known “alleged debtors” now that they face bankruptcy. The units should have their spending restricted immediately and eventually a trustee may need to be appointed to run them, the lenders said in court papers. Involuntary bankruptcy cases, which are brought by debt holders, require a company to either agree to put itself under court protection or fight creditors to have the petition thrown out. Firms including Redwood Capital Management, Veritas Capital and loan agent Glas Trust also signed onto the case, court papers show. Byju’s plans to challenge the case, which in an emailed statement it called “premature to say the least.” The company argues that some of the lenders are not legitimate owners of the debt because they are on a list of “disqualified” investors who, under the debt contracts, are barred from holding the loan. “The lenders claim to be creditors of these entities, notwithstanding that the question of whether the underlying loan amount is due and payable remains to be decided,” a company spokesperson said in an email, referring to a lawsuit challenging whether the $1.2 billion loan is in default. The units were affiliates of Byju’s Alpha until March 2023, when Glas Trust took control of the Alpha unit, according to court papers. Byju’s, once one of India’s hottest tech startups, has been in a prolonged fight with creditors over a debt restructuring. Raveendran built an aggressively expanding education company that was once valued at $22 billion but struggled when demand for tutoring dropped off as the pandemic waned and schools reopened. The company and its lenders are now battling in courts in Delaware and New York, primarily over where the troubled company stashed $533 million that jilted lenders say should go to them. The case is Epic! Creations, Inc., 24-11161, US Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).",

    "description": "Looking ahead, Wilson outlined plans to deploy new aircraft exclusively on international routes, including destinations such as New York, San Francisco, and Dubai. Related stories",
    "content": "Air India is set to undergo a significant transformation with plans to retrofit more than 100 aircraft, including 40 wide-body planes by 2025, as revealed by its Chief, Campbell Wilson, on June 5. This revamp also entails the procurement of around 25,000 aircraft seats. Expressing frustration over the pace of fleet upgrades, Wilson underscored the airline's commitment to enhancing customer experience with new products. \"Air India's fleet will be fitted with new seats by mid-2026,\" he added while speaking at the CAPA India Aviation Summit. Wilson emphasised that various initiatives are underway as part of Air India's transformation, with a focus on integration, growth, optimisation, and customer-centricity. He highlighted the flexibility within the Tata Group's aviation business, including both full and low-cost services, positioning Air India advantageously in the market. On the cost front, Wilson noted that airfares have been lagging behind overall inflation, reflecting ongoing challenges in the airline industry. Looking ahead, Wilson outlined plans to deploy new aircraft exclusively on international routes, including destinations such as New York, San Francisco, and Dubai. Additionally, Air India aims to establish itself as a hub carrier, with forthcoming operations centered around hubs in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. Notably, the airline is set to launch a London-Bengaluru flight in the near future. Meanwhile, Kapil Kaul, CEO \u0026 MD of CAPA, provided insights into the broader aviation landscape. He highlighted the Airports Authority of India's significant investment of $4 billion in expanding airport infrastructure in non-metro cities, with plans to privatize 25 more airports in the next financial year. Additionally, Kaul projected growth trends for the Indian aviation sector, forecasting a 6-8% increase in domestic passenger traffic and a 9-11% rise in international passenger traffic in FY25. He also anticipated a fleet expansion, with the number of aircraft operated by Indian airlines expected to reach 812 by the end of FY25, up from 728 currently. Speaking about delays on international flight, Campbell said that the airline could have better handled this ‘unusual combination of events\". He added that delays in Air India flight happened due to a combination of technical glitches and rostering issues. On May 31, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued a show-cause notice to Air India for inordinate delays of at least two international flights – AI 183 from Delhi to San Francisco on 30 May and AI 179 from Mumbai to San Francisco on 24 May – and its failure to take care of passengers. Then on June 2, an Air India flight from Delhi to Vancouver took off after a nearly 22-hour delay. More than 50 passengers of this flight protested against the airline inside the terminal. Wilson also said that there are plenty of changes planned for Air India, and its merger with Vistara is well on its track. Wilson said that “plenty of changes” will take place to make Air India bigger and better. He said new IT systems have been brought in. He also said that more than 100 aircraft will be retrofitted including 40 wide body aircraft. Wilson said the airline ordered about 25,000 new seats to be replaced in the aircraft, and $400 million has been spent on replacing the seats. They are focusing on integration, growth, optimisation and customer experience. The Air India CEO, however, said that increase in inflation has impacted the aviation sector, and that supply chain constraints are proving to be a challenge in improving the aircraft. Campbell also said that Air India new A 350 aircraft will be utilised for exclusive markets like Singapore, Dubai, and Frankfurt.",

    "content": "Mother Dairy on Monday announced Rs 2 per litre hike in milk prices in the Delhi-NCR market due to a rise in input cost over the last 15 months. The increase in prices of all variants of milk is effective from Monday (June 3) in Delhi-NCR as well as other markets where it has a presence. On Sunday, Amul announced an increase in rates. In a statement, Mother Dairy said it is \"increasing its liquid milk prices by Rs 2 per litre across all operating markets from June 03, 2024 onwards.\" The increase in consumer price is mainly to compensate the producers for increased production costs, which have been on the rise for over one year, it said. In Delhi-NCR, Mother Dairy full cream milk will be available now at Rs 68 per litre, while toned and double-toned milk at Rs 56 and Rs 50 per litre, respectively. Buffalo and cow milk prices have been increased to Rs 72 and Rs 58 per litre respectively. Token milk (bulk vended milk) will be sold at Rs 54 per litre. Mother Dairy, which currently sells 35 lakh litre per day of fresh milk in Delhi-NCR, said it had last revised its liquid milk prices in February 2023. \"Despite paying higher prices towards milk procurement in the last few months, the consumer prices were kept intact. Moreover, the heat stress across the country has been unprecedented and it is likely to further impact milk production,\" Mother Dairy said. The company highlighted that it passes an average of around 75- 80 per cent of the sales realisation from milk towards its procurement. This helps in ensuring the sustenance of dairy farming and the availability of quality milk. \"The surge in farm prices is only being partially passed on to the consumers, with an effective revision of 3-4 per cent, thereby securing the interests of both the milk producers and the consumers,\" Mother Dairy said. On late Sunday, the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which markets dairy products under the Amul brand, increased milk prices by about Rs 2 per litre from Monday across the country. The increase of Rs 2 per litre translates to 3-4 per cent increase in MRP which is much lower than average food inflation, GCMMF said in a late night statement. GCMMF said that since February 2023, it has not made any increase in prices of fresh pouch milk in major markets. \"This price hike is being done due to an increase in the overall cost of operation and production of milk. Our member unions have also increased farmer's price approximately by 6-8 per cent over the last one year,\" GCMMF said. Amul as a policy passes on almost 80 paise of every rupee paid by consumers for milk and milk products to the milk producers. \"The price revision shall help in sustaining remunerative milk prices to our milk producers and to encourage them for higher milk production,\" the statement had said.",

    "content": "Adani Group companies posted a record 45 per cent rise in pre-tax profit (EBITDA) to Rs 82,917 crore (about USD 10 billion) in FY24 as the apples-to-airport conglomerate made a massive comeback, the group said on Sunday. Emerging from a damning report of a US short seller, which hit the market value of its listed companies, Adani Group in 2023-24 focused on containing debt, reducing founder share pledge and consolidating the business in core competencies. The five-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) for profit growth was 54 per cent. As much as 84 per cent of EBITDA is from 'core infrastructure' businesses, providing highly predictable cash flows. Strong Asset Base built over three decades supporting resilient critical infrastructure stands at Rs 4,78,137 crore (USD 57 billion) - this asset base serves a consumer base of 350 million users. \"The performances for FY24 (2023-24 fiscal) and the past five years signify the strength and stability of Adani portfolio and the robustness of its businesses that despite all the external volatilities and headwinds continue to deliver strong and consistent growth year after year. It also highlights its superior capital allocation strategy that maximises returns and minimises risks,\" the statement said. From FY19 to FY24, Adani portfolio's gross assets increased at a 25 per cent CAGR, while EBITDA grew at 27 per cent CAGR. In comparison, the net debt increased at only 14 per cent. \"This exhibits the group's exceptional capability in efficiently deploying the capital,\" it said. \"In FY24, the Adani portfolio of companies rose to their best, delivering record EBITDA growth of 45 per cent. With surging cash flows and enhanced credit profiles, Adani portfolio of companies are in a 'Stronger than Ever' position to accelerate growth investments,\" it added. The consumer user base of the platform has increased to 350 million, with fast-growing consumer franchises across airports, electricity distribution, smart metering, gas distribution and direct-to-consumer digital platform. \"Rising cash flows from rapidly growing profits have lowered the net leverage significantly,\" it said. \"The portfolio is now very conservatively leveraged with net debt to EBITDA as low as 2.2x; down from 3.3x - this demonstrates a disciplined growth profile providing stable, predictable and resilient performance year-on-year,\" it said. The assured cash flows with multi-decadal visibility give Adani portfolio companies an advantage over the industry. It enables them to optimise leveraging i.e. operate at higher net debt to EBITDA than industry benchmark, yet with lower risks. This leads to faster asset addition, higher growth and maximising returns for shareholders. At 2.2x, Adani portfolio has a balance sheet capacity for even higher growth. \"Total Gross Assets increased by Rs 65,901 crore (USD 8 billion) and now stand at Rs 4,78,220 crore (USD 57.4 billion),\" it said. \"Adani Enterprises Ltd housing green hydrogen, airports business and Adani Green Energy Ltd implementing renewable power generation capacity witnessed the highest gross asset additions or 61 per cent of the total gross asset added. The gains from these will reflect in FY25 earnings.\" Adani group said high liquidity is maintained with a cash balance at 24.8 per cent of gross debt. A cash balance of Rs 59,791 crore (USD 7.2 billion) provides benchmark liquidity cover. In FY24, the group's flagship Adani Enterprises commissioned an ingot wafer unit as part of solar module manufacturing, wind turbine facility and copper smelter. Adani Cement completed the Sanghi Cement acquisition while promoters infused more funds into the company. Adani Ports acquired Gopalpur port, Adani Power commissioned a 1.6 GW Godda power plant, Adani Green added 2.8 GW renewable energy capacity and commenced operations of a solar power project in Khavda, Gujarat, and Adani Energy Solutions put up 1,244 circuit kilometres of transmission lines.",

    "content": "Domestic passenger vehicle segment is expected to cross the 50 lakh-mark of annual sales over the next few years and Tata Motors is geared up to tap into this growth opportunity, according to Tata Group Chairman N Chandrasekaran. In a message to the company's shareholders in Annual Report for 2023-24, he noted that the company will focus on revenue growth and strong free cash flows across its businesses going ahead. \"India is well on track to exceed the 5 million vehicle sales mark in passenger vehicles over the next few years from the 4.1 million volumes clocked last year,\" Chandrasekaran said. \"Tata Motors is well placed to further strengthen its market position and tap into this growth opportunity,\" Chandrasekaran stated. Elaborating on the passenger vehicle segment, he stated that in the next phase the business will focus on driving revenue growth, improving EBITDA, strong free cash flows, technology and brand leadership. Apart from vehicular sales, the business will also focus on vehicle parc linked businesses like spares, digital and smart mobility solutions which will help reduce the volatility of the vehicle sales business, he added. This should help drive consistent value accretive growth in the coming years, Chandrasekaran said. The competitive intensity in this portfolio will remain high and the business will continue to invest in products, platforms, electrical \u0026 electronic architectures, and vehicle software to remain competitive, he stated. The EV business will focus on driving up penetration through multiple product launches, focus on market development, charging network enhancements and continuing to introduce aspirational product features, Chandrasekaran said. The company's PV business recorded its highest-ever turnover in FY24 with an annual revenue of Rs 52,353 crore, growing by 9.4 per cent over FY23. Chandrasekaran said the commercial vehicle vertical will also focus on vehicle parc linked businesses to reduce the volatility of the vehicle sales business. On JLR, he stated that the brand will continue to double down on its journey to become a premium luxury OEM, deliver strong revenue growth, improve profitability further, drive positive free cash flows and continue to invest in products and technologies. \"There is an exciting range of products lined up to be launched over the next three years that needs to be delivered successfully. The first electric Range Rover launches later this year, and there are further EVs lined up in the coming years including the all-electric Jaguar,\" he said. Chandrasekaran said that to enable execution of these well differentiated strategies and to further empower each business to pursue it purposefully, the Tata Motors' board has proposed the demerger of the company into two separate listed companies. The commercial vehicle business and its related investments in one entity and the passenger vehicle businesses including PV, EV, JLR and its related investments in another entity, he informed shareholders. \"This will also help secure the considerable synergies across PV, EV and JLR particularly in the areas of EVs, autonomous vehicles, and vehicle software,\" Chandrasekaran said. This will lead each company to deliver a superior experience for customers, better growth prospects for employees and, enhanced value for shareholders, he added. Chandrasekaran said the global geo-political scenario continues to be tense with continuing military conflicts. These have created immense hardships for the affected people and also resulted in supply chain disruptions, he stated. As the year draws to a close, the economic scenario is stabilising with global growth estimated to be around 3 per cent during the next couple of years, he said.",

    "content": "Women clothing brand Libas, which on Thursday announced securing Rs 150 crore funding, aims to double its sales in the next two years to Rs 1,000 crore, said its Founder and CEO Siddhant Keshwani. Zivore Apparel, the company which owns the brand Libas, on Thursday, announced the closing of its first external funding round, with an investment of Rs 150 crore by IAF Series 5, a fund managed by ICICI Venture. Infusion of this fresh capital is expected to help build an omnichannel presence for Libas with strengthening of its current digital presence and accelerate offline expansion. The fast fashion ethnic wear brand, which started its journey as a D2C brand in 2014, has adopted an omnichannel strategy and is targeting to have a network of 150 physical stores in the next 3-5 years. Though Libas's immediate focus is on metros for expansion in the brick-mortar format, it recognizes the potential for growth in tier II and III cities and is leveraging data-driven insights to strategically target these areas in the future. The company is adopting the company-owned, company-operated (COCO) model for its stores, focusing initially on metro cities and select smaller towns with a strong online presence and customer base, he added. Besides the domestic market, Libas is also planning for the international market, targeting the Indian diaspora, especially in markets such as the UK, USA, UAE, and Australia, where it is serving through its online platform. When asked about the growth, Keshwani told PTI: \"We are targeting internally that we should close FY26 at about Rs 1,000 crore net revenue -- majorly being driven through our offline channels and, and of course online as well.\" The company has crossed a milestone of Rs 500 crore revenue in the financial year ended March 2024. Currently, online sales account for approximately 80-85 per cent of our business, with offline sales contributing around 10 to 15 per cent, he said. \"However, we aim to achieve a more balanced distribution, targeting 50-60 per cent online and 30-40 per cent offline sales in the next two to three years,\" Keshwani added. Currently, around 50 to 55 per cent of Libas business is contributed by the metro markets, and the rest comes from tier II, III and below towns. When asked about the current market condition and demand for apparel, which had faced a slowdown in demand as customers have put their discretionary spending on hold tightening their purses, Keshwani said there are \"signs of recovery\". \"Despite recent economic challenges, we are starting to see signs of recovery and an upward trend in consumer spending, particularly as we approach the festive season. We remain cautiously optimistic about the future growth prospects of the industry,\" he said.",

    "content": "The massive valuations of Indian corporates, including the USD 100 billion of his own company, are the result of a stable and solid economy under \"a very solid leader,\" Airtel founder Sunil Mittal has said. In an interview to Economic Times published Thursday, Mittal said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's unequivocal message of his government not siding with any corporate during an 'inspiring' meeting in 2018 marked a pivotal moment for Bharti Airtel, helping it grow in midst of intense competition from new entrant Reliance Jio. Mittal said he met Modi in September 2018 when the prime minister told him that his government will play by the book, not side with anyone and will do what is good for the country. \"And to my mind, a lot of statements that this government is only favouring a few are all absolutely misplaced,\" Mittal said. \"Money is pouring into this country, a lot of capital is coming in, the stock market is rising. These massive valuations are a function of a stable, solid, functional economy under a very solid leader,\" he said. Mittals rival bil'ionaire Mukesh Ambani's Jio disrupted the telecom market in 2016 with free voice and data services that helped it topple Airtel to become the nation's No.1 telecom firm. Reeling under the heat of market onslaught, Airtel at that time had felt that some decisions of the telecom regulator had adverse impact on the incumbent market leader. In September 2018, he sought a meeting with the PM when Mittal was still the chairman of GSMA, a lobby group representing the interests of mobile network operators, and had just completed his chairmanship of the International Chambers of Commerce. In that capacity too he used to brief Modi occasionally on WTO, G20 and other issues. \"So I took the liberty and took his permission to talk about the Indian telecom industry. I told him that things were going very badly and the situation was getting very alarming,\" Mittal said, referring to the free voice and data services offered by Jio and a slew of regulations that he felt favoured one side. Recalling his meeting with Modi where both spoke in Hindi, Mittal said he told the PM: \"I will fight in the marketplace, but I can't fight the government.\" \"He (PM) told me that his government will not tilt towards either side. Whatever is good for the country will be done. You fight in the marketplace. I don't have a view on that. But from the side of the government you can be assured that the government will not take sides,\" he said recalling Modi's words. And that, he said, \"was enough\" for him. \"I got up and thanked him... this was the turning point (for Airtel),\" he said. Mittal said he derived an inexplicable energy and inspiration from the meeting. \"Sometimes you need inspiration. I do that to my troops. I needed that from someone. There was a very strong special message (from the PM). Fight in the market. Here was a man telling me - who has himself fought against a lot of odds - that you do your work and be very assured that this government is going to only do things that are good for the nation.\" He said he started looking at the regulations - that he believed were not good for Airtel - in a larger perspective. \"Maybe lower tariffs were better ... lower tariffs were better to democratise the data services. You start to see things in a different context, because you are reassured that there is no agenda here,\" he said. Jio's entry completely changed the scenario of Internet in India as affordable data tariffs led to mass penetration of smartphones. This helped accelerate adoption of things like digital payments.",

    "content": "Shriram Life Insurance Company Ltd has drawn up plans to bolster its presence by expanding into tier 2 and 3 towns across 15 states in the country. The insurance major would emphasize customer segments where the need for life insurance is the highest, yet have been financially underserved, company Managing Director and CEO Casparus J H Kromhout said. \"What we realized was that we are in more than 15 states and we need to focus on growing deeper into states where the need (for insurance) is more. So, we have identified 15 states and we will apply all our business models and we can make bigger business in those states rather than going here and there,\" he told PTI in an interaction. \"In order to have a sustainable company you have to make sure that you are as efficient as possible and one way to do that is to focus on deepening your penetration into a state rather than just going here and there. You cannot be here and there. That is the main reason behind that and we can also ensure that the state is properly serviced,\" he said. Asked to share names of some of the states that the company was planning to foray into, he said the company has a strong footprint in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu. \"If you look at Uttar Pradesh, it is a very large state. Very under-penetrated. Odisha and Bihar,\" he said. According to company officials, the Southern region contributes the majority of retail NB premium contribution at 47 per cent followed by the East and North East at 16 per cent. Central and Western parts of the country contribute 14 per cent each, while North stands at 10 per cent. Shriram Life Insurance has partnered with cooperative and regional rural banks and reaped success. \"We work closely with them (regional rural banks, cooperative banks). It is not only getting a partner and then asking them to do business, we have to co-create solutions and work with them. We are also looking at interesting partners in other industries as well,\" he said. Shriram Life Insurance recorded a profit after tax of Rs 158 crore for the financial year ending March 31, 2024, as compared to Rs 156 crore registered a year ago. The company witnessed a 62 per cent surge in new business premiums at Rs 1,871 crore in FY 2023-24 as against Rs 1,152 crore registered in the previous financial year. Individual and new business premiums grew 39 per cent during the year ending March 31, 2024, at Rs 938 crore as compared to Rs 675 crore recorded a year ago. Responding to a query on the financial performance, he said the 62 per cent growth was contributed by group business and individual retail business. \"The important focus (for Shriram Life Insurance in the current financial year) is individual and retail business. We have achieved 39 per cent (growth in the last financial year) and we will try to another 30-40 per cent in the current (financial) year. So, we will keep building on the retail business,\" he said. Shriram Life Insurance has embarked on sales diversification by developing in-house sales capacity as well as partnerships with banks and other institutions, the company said.",

    "content": "The country’s largest lender, the State Bank of India (SBI), has asked its employees to seek permission before opening demat or trading accounts with service providers outside the group. A breach of the instruction would be treated as gross misconduct and punishable, an internal circular, dated May 27, has said. Moneycontrol has reviewed a copy of the circular. “No officer/award staff shall open their or their wholly dependent family member’s demat account and or trading account outside the State Bank Group without prior permission of his / her controller not below rank of Chief General Manager,” the circular says. “Breach of these instructions shall be treated as a misconduct punishable amongst others under Rule No. 50(1), 50(4), 50 (11) read with Rule 66 of SBIOSR for officers,” the circular says. A demat is an online portfolio that makes the process of holding investments such as shares, bonds, mutual funds and ETFs easier, doing away with the physical handling and trading paper shares and other documents. SBI is yet to respond to Moneycontrol’s emailed queries. The bank has also asked the employees to submit their details and those of their “dependent” family members’ demat account statements to their controllers for verification. The staff must also obtain de facto permission from their controllers within six months from the date of issue of the instructions or close such accounts during the period. And legal experts highlighted that a company cannot impose on its employees to use the services of the employer group. \"Banks and companies may issue caution to employees for trading as it is done during the normal working hours. Since they also have policies under which employees have to make declaration about their investments, they cannot prohibit using services outside their company or group,\" said Mukesh Chand, Senior Legal Counsel · Economic Laws Practice (ELP). Demat account boom India had 151 million demat accounts at the end of the financial year 2023-24, data analysed by brokerage Motilal Oswal shows. As many as 3.1 million new accounts were added in March alone. “This trend seems to be continuing throughout the year, with an average of 3.1 million new accounts opened each month in the financial year 2024 (FY24),” Motilal Oswal said. Groww emerged as the largest broker, with a market share of 23.4 percent, handling an active client base of 9.5 million in FY24, Motilal Oswal said in another report, citing National Stock Exchange (NSE) data. The broker recorded a 77.5 percent jump in the active client base in FY24 and a 42 percent overall jump in the market share. Next in line is Zerodha, which recorded a 14 percent jump in the number of active clients touching 7.3 million.

    "content": "LIC chairman Siddhartha Mohanty has said that the insurer would enter into the health insurance segment and can explore inorganic options if such an opportunity arises. There are expectations that composite licences may be permitted by amending the Insurance Act. As per the Insurance Act, 1938, and the regulations of the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDAI), composite licensing for an insurer to undertake life, general, or health insurance under one entity is not allowed. LIC is not an expert in general insurance like fire and engineering but it can do health insurance, he said while sharing financial numbers for FY24. In February, a parliamentary panel suggested the introduction of a composite licence for an insurer to undertake life, general, or health insurance under one entity to increase the penetration of insurance in the country. The panel headed by BJP leader Jayant Sinha had suggested the government to introduce a provision of composite licensing for insurance companies and make the related amendment in legislation at the earliest. Observing that allowing composite licensing could provide further impetus to the insurance sector, owing to its various benefits, the report had said it can cut costs and compliance hassles for insurers, as they can run different insurance lines under one roof. It can also offer customers more choice and value, such as a single policy that covers life, health, and savings, the report tabled in Parliament had said. It can boost insurance reach and awareness in India, as customers can get one insurance from one provider, with lower premiums and easier claims. The committee are aware that to enable composite licensing in India, the government and the IRDAI are planning to bring amendments to the existing insurance legislation, it had said. Meanwhile, insurance behemoth LIC on Monday posted a marginal 2 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 13,763 crore in the fourth quarter ended March 2024 as the corporation made provisions for wage hikes. The insurer had earned a profit of Rs 13,428 crore in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. The total income of the insurer during the reporting quarter rose to Rs 2,50,923 crore from Rs 2,00,185 crore in the same period of the preceding fiscal. LIC's income from first-year premium also improved to Rs 13,810 crore in the latest January-March quarter against Rs 12,811 crore in the same period of the preceding fiscal. The income from renewal premiums in the reporting period rose to Rs 77,368 crore compared to Rs 76,009 crore a year ago. During the entire financial year ended March 2024, the insurer earned a profit of Rs 40,676 crore as compared to Rs 36,397 crore in the previous fiscal. The total premium income for the year ended March 2024 was Rs 4,75,070 crore as compared to Rs 4,74,005 crore in the year ended March 2023. A total of 2,03,92,973 policies were sold in the individual segment in FY24 as compared to 2,04,28,937 policies sold previous fiscal. The board recommended a final dividend of Rs 6 per share for 2023-24 subject to approval of shareholders, Mohanty said. Earlier, during the year an interim dividend of Rs 4 was declared and paid to shareholders of the corporation. Therefore, he said, the total interim and recommended final dividend aggregates to Rs 10 per share.",

    "content": "Japan's Sony has appointed a Walt Disney executive, Gaurav Banerjee, as its new India chief executive to lead its television and other media businesses, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. Banerjee has resigned from Disney's India unit where he was the head of content for its streaming service, Hotstar, and head of business for the company's TV channels in Hindi-speaking markets, one source said. A second source said Banerjee would join Sony in about two months. Last week, Sony said it was looking for a successor to its current India chief executive, N.P. Singh, who had decided to move on. Sony runs 26 channels in India, from general entertainment to sports and movies, and also a streaming service. This year, it scrapped a planned merger with India's Zee Entertainment that would have created a $10-billion enterprise. Banerje's departure from Disney comes as the U.S. firm seeks Indian regulators' approval to merge its India media assets with those of Reliance, which is led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, in a combination making it India's biggest entertainment company.",

    "content": "TCS and IIT Bombay announced on May 28 that they are working together to develop India's first quantum diamond microchip imager. According to an official statement, a quantum diamond microchip imager is able to image magnetic fields, allowing for a non-invasive and non-destructive mapping of semiconductor chips, similar to an MRI at a hospital. The statement further stated that this technology is essential given the difficulties in detecting anomalies caused by traditional sensing methods due to semiconductors' shrinking size. According to a filing to the stock exchanges, the country's largest IT services and IIT Bombay have formed a strategic agreement to develop an improved sensing tool for semiconductor chip imaging. This sophisticated sensing instrument has the potential to decrease chip failures, increase the energy efficiency of electronic devices, and open up new avenues for precision in the analysis of semiconductor chips. It stated that India will advance in the quantum revolution with the help of an indigenous quantum diamond microchip imager that combines quantum diamond microscopy with software imaging powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. TCS experts will collaborate with Kasturi Saha, an associate professor at the top technology institute, to create the PQuest Lab's quantum imaging platform. According to Saha, using its experience in quantum sensing to spur innovation, the two companies will collaborate on a quantum imaging platform for the non-destructive inspection of chips. \"By working together, we aim to transform various sectors, including electronics and healthcare, and propel India forward through groundbreaking technologies and products aligned with National Quantum Mission's Quantum Sensing and Metrology vertical,\" he said in a statement. What are semiconductor chips? All contemporary electronic gadgets use semiconductor chips, and the two partners' effort over the next two years is intended to increase the devices' dependability, security, and energy efficiency. According to the statement, the chips serve as the brains of devices in a variety of industries, including communications, computers, healthcare, military systems, transportation, and clean energy. They can interpret data and perform tasks. TCS and IIT-B have been working together on several projects since the 1990s. The imager detects and characterises anomalies in semiconductor chips by utilising hardware and software with Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centres, which are structural defects in diamonds.",

In three years, it aims to have 25,000 cars, he said. India’s top EV ride-hailer seeks $300 million to expand car fleetRelated stories",
    "content": "BluSmart, India’s biggest electric cab operator, wants to raise more than $300 million in three years to add thousands of cars to its fleet in its push to take on the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. in the fast-growing market. The company will increase its Indian fleet of electric vehicles — supplied by Tata Motors Ltd., BYD Co., SAIC Motor Corp.’s MG Motor and Stellantis NV’s Citroën — to 13,000 by March from 7,500 currently, Punit Goyal, co-founder of the BP Ventures-backed startup, said in an interview. In three years, it aims to have 25,000 cars, he said. Part of the funding it raises will go toward the company’s expansion beyond Delhi and the southern Indian city of Bengaluru. BluSmart will launch in Dubai next month with about 100 Audi EVs, and plans to run 300 Audi and Tesla Inc. vehicles there by December, according to Goyal. “We don’t want to go to small cities because that’s not where the revenue comes from,” said Goyal. “Cheap rides, cheap quality, cheap service and cheap pricing are not our forte.” The company estimates it will almost double annual revenue to $110 million by March 2025, based on its current monthly financial performance. Goyal didn’t say when he expects the company would make a profit. Going ElectricWhile BluSmart has consistently maintained an all-electric fleet, its rivals are also rolling out greener options to customers. Uber last year said it will add 25,000 electric vehicles to its platform in India, though didn’t specify a timeline, and Ola began deploying 10,000 electric scooters earlier this year. Road transport is estimated to account for as much as 30% of the air pollution that can shroud India’s biggest urban centers, according to the International Energy Agency, causing dangerous long-term health impacts and even premature deaths. Electrification is a core pillar to the country’s pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2070, but efforts have been stymied by the high cost of buying an EV and limited charging infrastructure. Ride-hailing also plays a complicated role: a non-pooled ride-hailing trip produces about 47% more emissions than a private car trip, though taking a journey in an EV can cut emissions by about half, according to US-based nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. BluSmart, which has secured $200 million in equity and long-term growth debt so far, is currently raising $25 million that Goyal said includes investment from its founders, existing investors, family offices and founders of other startups.The funding round, which is part of its three-year $300-million plan, will close by late June, he said. Despite the looming foray into Dubai, Goyal said its home market of India will continue to be the company’s core focus. “You can fit 15 Singapores in terms of population” in the area around the capital of Delhi, he said. “That’s a huge opportunity and that’s where the key market is.”",

    "content": "Tata Motors owned Jaguar Land Rover expects to grow faster than the luxury car segment this fiscal, as it bolsters localisation and expands product range, according to a top company executive. The company, which is set to commence local assembly of Range Rover and Range Rover Sport in India, witnessed a sales growth of 81 per cent in 2023-24 fiscal year at 4,436 units, as compared to FY23. The automaker aims to double its business in India over the next three years. Initiatives like enhanced localisation of products, which would lead to reduction in prices and expansion of sales network in the country would help the company in growing faster than the industry, he added. Citing reports, Amba noted that the number of high net-worth individuals (HNIs) is expected to double between 2023 and 2027 and thus there's so much headroom for the growth of the premium-end car segment, he stated. He noted that in five years time, the domestic luxury car segment should double from the current size of 48,000 units per annum. \"So as we build up and put more and more cars on the road and get more and more visibility for our cars, that will add to the desirability and in the growth of the brand,\" Amba said. It is a sequential process as the automaker continues to create various experiences like the Range Rover House and expands its sales network, he stated. \"And as we grow bigger in size, we also then start to get new allocations (from HQ),\" he said. Amba noted that the company plans to keep introducing both internal combustion engine and battery electric vehicles to cater to the customer demand. \"We are not shying away from bringing everything that is being offered outside into India because you're just finding tremendous consumer support,\" he added. When asked about the sales network, Amba said the company would be undertaking expansion in new regions. \"We will be expanding, we have been largely constant for the last four or five years with 25 showrooms. But now's the time to start looking at expansion,\" he said. He, however, did not elaborate on the number of the outlets the automaker intends to set up going ahead. \"We are not in a hurry to grow the brand. We want to grow it steadily and make sure that our partners are happy and profitable. We are only in 21 cities so there's so much scope,\" Amba said.",

    "content": "Commercial vehicle major Ashok Leyland has an \"internal target\" of launching a product in each fuel type within the next 18 to 24 months, even if there is no guarantee of widespread deployment, said chairman Dheeraj Hinduja. In an exclusive chat with CNBC-TV18, Hinduja stated that challenges such as the availability of facilities to produce hydrogen-powered vehicles could impede the pace of their deployment. \"We have an internal target of launching vehicles powered by all alternate fuels within 18 to 24 months, but I cannot comment on how many alternate-fuel vehicles we will deploy,\" said Hinduja, adding that several customers have shown keen interest in vehicles across fuel types. Hinduja's comments come as Leyland has been doubling its investments in its EV subsidiary, Switch Mobility. In December 2023, the company invested Rs 662 crore in Switch, followed by an additional Rs 537 crore earlier this year. The company will continue investing in its EV arm and is not in a hurry to find an external investor. This contrasts starkly with Leyland's approach in 2021, when the CV manufacturer was hunting for investors at the height of the EV boom. However, despite substantial offers via the SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) route, Leyland surprised the market and observers alike by turning them down. \"We didn't see the right opportunity,\" says Hinduja today. \"Switch was valued at billions of dollars, but we didn't think it was justified.\" Today, Ashok Leyland is committed to investing in the EV firm, thanks to its fiscal health: \"Our balance sheet is strong, we remain largely debt-free, and funding Switch Mobility is not a challenge.\" Hinduja added: \"We are open to external funding for Switch in the long run, with the right opportunity, but at present, there are no plans to bring in an external investor.\" Objectively, Switch Mobility remains a solid asset. Leyland has optimised costs at its subsidiary by manufacturing EVs within its facilities. All investments towards Switch Mobility have been deployed purely towards product development, and a healthy product pipeline has resulted from such measures. \"We have invested heavily in Switch's recent 12-metre electric bus and the electric LCV launches,\" said Hinduja. \"We will be launching the low-floor 12-metre electric bus and the 9-metre electric bus, and will be launching our first European electric bus, the e1, for the Spanish market this summer.\" To further boost cost optimisation, the management is not looking to open a dedicated Switch Mobility plant anytime soon: \"When volumes ramp up to necessitate a separate facility, we will build one, but we can continue building Switch Mobility products from Ashok Leyland's facilities for the next 12 to 18 months.\" These plans indicate that Leyland is not considering a demerger of the EV business: \"It makes sense to keep the companies together,\" Hinduja said. \"Energy transition is happening slower than estimated, and we have time to think of ideas and strategies for the EV business.\" Hinduja also ruled out the possibility of Leyland acquiring EV companies in the near term: \"The priority is to keep building our product pipeline; there are no talks to acquire any company at present.\" In line with building product pipelines, twin investments in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh are expected to hold Leyland in good stead. In January, the company announced an investment commitment of Rs 1,200 crore at the Tamil Nadu Global Investor Meet. A month later, it unveiled plans to build a plant in Lucknow. \"The UP plant will be predominantly focused on building electric buses,\" said Hinduja. \"We are looking at a timeline of 12 to 13 months to begin operations with a production of 2,500 electric buses, with the ability to ramp up to 5,000 electric buses.\" He added: \"In Tamil Nadu, we are investing in capacity optimisation and our alternate-fuel products.\" On the ICE (internal combustion engine) front, Ashok Leyland recently displaced Tata Motors to occupy the #2 spot in the pick-up truck segment, with a market share of 20%. During this time, its overall LCV sales have bucked market trends to grow at a healthy rate. \"The LCV segment still has plenty of room to grow — we are covering merely 50% of it,\" said Hinduja. \"We will launch six new LCV models in this fiscal year and will continue investing in the segment.\" Despite concerns over falling factory output and mining at a 19-month low, Hinduja said that the general growth in infrastructure and all-round buoyancy will keep markets alive. While observers claim the ongoing general election could impact the markets, the Ashok Leyland chairman believes \"businesses will adjust to whatever the outcome of the election is.\" Hinduja said FAME III incentives must incentivise the purchase of electric trucks to accelerate the energy transition, adding that India would do well to learn from the China story before deciding whether to withdraw EV incentives. \"We must note how Chinese EV sales slowed down when incentives were withdrawn; I think the Indian government must continue incentivising both the manufacturing and purchase of EVs.\" A few months ago, Ashok Leyland celebrated the completion of 75 years in its journey. The company outlined plans to be among the top 10 global CV manufacturers. \"We have a clear blueprint on how we want to get there,\" said Hinduja. \"A 75-year-old company like ours will need to reinvent itself to compete with the best in the world. We have developed new purpose, culture, innovation, and trust to be among the global top 10.\" He added that the company's network in the GCC, Africa, and Indonesia will help it reach its goals soon. On the earnings front, the company's FY-24 net profits have risen by 90%, from Rs 1,380 crore at the end of FY-23 to Rs 2,618 crore last fiscal. Revenue from operations also grew by 6%, with the company reporting that all its business verticals outperformed. \"The last few quarters demonstrate that we can deliver our promises to our investors,\" he said. \"We will continue to grow our market share and keep improving financial performance.\"",

Three fourths of the funding is equity infusion for a minority stake, while the rest is debt, Indya's co-founder Shivani Poddar said. Other investors who have participated include family offices of SRF Group, Krishna Bodanapu of Cyient Technologies and Timmy Sarna from Pure Home + Living. Anurag Murali, also a co-founder of the company, said Indya can benefit from JSW's expertise in celebrity-led marketing and supply chain management in the future. It can be noted that a majority of big conglomerates have investments in fashion brands but nearly all such groups have retail ventures. The 2012-founded Indya, which delivered operational profit in April this year, will be utilising the newly raised funds for business expansion, and plans to invest up to USD 3 million in FY25, which will include opening ten offline stores in the country, Murali said. At present, it has 12 exclusive brand outlets in eight cities, and 150 large-format retail outlets, including Lifestyle, Shoppers Stop, Centro and Ethnicity. Having been active in selling its wares online in the US, the brand is also aiming to open a physical presence either in the US or South Africa in FY25, he added. In a statement, Sangita Jindal said along with the global expansion, the investment will also help the brand widen its market share in the Indian wedding-wear opportunity.

    "description": "NGIC, which is planning to begin operations by the end of this year, will provide 5G broadband services to mobile operators and internet services providers in Ghana.Billionaire Mukesh Ambani sets sights on Africa with telecom ventureRelated stories",
    "content": "Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani is set to enter Africa with a telecoms venture, seeking to win mobile broadband customers in a high-growth market. Radisys Corp., a unit of Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries Ltd., will provide key network infrastructure, applications and smartphones for Ghana-based Next-Gen InfraCo., according to Harkirit Singh, the executive director of NGIC. He described the plans ahead of NGIC’s launch announcement on Monday in Mumbai, India’s financial hub. NGIC, which is planning to begin operations by the end of this year, will provide 5G broadband services to mobile operators and internet services providers in Ghana. Other strategic partners in NGIC include Nokia Oyj, Indian outsourcer Tech Mahindra Ltd. and Microsoft Corp., which has increasingly sharpened its focus on the telecoms business following an acquisition of two cloud networking firms in 2020. Ghana, a West African country with a population of just over 33 million, has three main operators: MTN Ghana, Vodafone Ghana and state-run AirtelTigo. NGIC’s strategic partners, its technological prowess and the company’s possession of Ghana’s only 5G license will help it build broadband services at scale, a huge expense for individual mobile carriers, Singh said. Two African telecoms firms — Ascend Digital Solutions Ltd. and K-NET — hold a combined stake of 55% in the new company, said Singh. The Ghana government will own just under 10% of NGIC, while local mobile operators and private investors will retain the remaining shares in the firm. Singh is also the chief executive of Ascend. NGIC has the exclusive right to offer 5G services in Ghana for a decade, though its license is valid for 15 years. The company’s capital expenditure for three years is $145 million, according to Singh. The company is looking to emulate the success of Ambani’s Jio Infocomm Ltd. in India. Jio launched telecoms services in India in late 2016 with low-cost data and free voice calling, forcing some rivals to shut down and others to consolidate. It is widely credited for making mobile data affordable to hundreds of million of Indians. Jio is currently India’s biggest mobile operator with 470 million users. NGIC will provide “affordable mobile broadband services and devices to the people of Ghana, replicating the success of India’s low-cost mobile data revolution,” Ghana’s Minister for Communications and Digitalization Ursula Owusu-Ekuful said in a statement. The Reliance-NGIC partnership is also a diplomatic win for India, which has sought to counter China’s surging influence in Africa via measures such as digital inclusion. None of the strategic partners, including Reliance, currently own any equity in NGIC. But the company will give them an option to accept part of their payments as equity in the future, Singh said. “First we have to be successful to show the value that we create before they come in,” Singh said. “That’s the discussion we’re having with them.” Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.",

The JSW Group firm, which aims for Rs 5,000 crore revenue in the next two years, is expanding its retail presence in the home decorative business and adding more products in the industrial coating business, company's Joint Managing Director \u0026 CEO Sundaresan AS said. \"We have been able to achieve operating breakeven this year (FY24),\" Sundaresan told PTI. \"We aim to keep growing anywhere from 5 to 10 times the market growth. In the current year (FY24), We have grown 10 times the rest of the industry,\" he said adding that JSW Paints is bringing new products into the market, expanding its reach and network and continuing to invest in building the brands. Asked about JSW Paints' target to have Rs 5,000 crore revenue within the next two years, Sundaresan said: \"We believe it is possible.\" \"Of course, it has to be aided by a buoyant market and if you keep doing the right things which we have been doing. We have always believed in taking the aspirational goals and working towards them systematically. So we believe it is possible,\" he added. Currently, JSW Paints has a network of 6,000 retailers across the country and will continue to expand it further. \"So we keep adding anywhere from 2,000 to 2,500 retailers annually, which we will continue to do,\" he said. JSW Paints has so far invested Rs 900 crore for its decorative and industrial coating business. Regarding the paints market, Sundaresan said, the industry has been growing at double-digit in the last few decades and is expected to do so going forward. It is a growing market and has a place for newcomers in the segment. In the Indian paints market, in the last 4-5 years, several new players including Aditya Birla Group, Pidilite and some others have entered into the segment. \"This is going to add more value to the industry, quality competition and new offerings,\" Sundaresan said. JSW Paints is trying to make a \"significant difference\" in terms of its offerings and has achieved this milestone in a short span of time despite two years being lost in COVID, he added. \"We have already faced the existing competition actively over the last five years. We believe JSW Paints will be able to face both the existing as well as new competition which is coming into the industry well with our approach and difference we can make in industry,\" he said. Launched in May 2019, JSW Paints is a part of the USD 24 billion JSW Group, whose business interests span sectors such as steel, energy, maritime infrastructure, defence, B2B e-commerce, realty, cement, sports and venture capital.",

    "content": "Reliance Industries Ltd.’s new venture, Tira, is leaning on artificial intelligence tools that can suggest perfumes or cosmetics to woo customers in the burgeoning but competitive Indian beauty sector. Tira, which was launched by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s conglomerate in April last year, also uses electronic vending machines in its stores to dispense free samples of skincare products, according to Tejas Kapadia, head of marketing of the year-old startup that has 12 stores across India and a website. “Customers love that and they keep coming back for that,” Kapadia said in Tira’s first interview since its launch. The idea is to give a “plethora of experiences” using “some form of AI,” he added. Its “skin analyzer” infers the features of a customer by clicking a photo and recommends products that would suit them best. Its stores offer a free engraving service for buyers to personalize their purchases by etching names on perfumes bottles or make-up boxes. The website also provides makeup and skincare lessons. Race to EnterTira is Reliance’s lead horse in the race for the world’s fastest growing major beauty market. The conglomerate’s retail business, helmed by Ambani’s daughter Isha, has also taken over the local operations of skincare brand Kiko Milano and LVMH Group’s luxury beauty retailer Sephora in the past one year. Tira is competing with brands like Tata Group’s Palette and current market leader, Nykaa. The local beauty segment is expected to grow at 10% between 2022 and 2027, according to a September report by RedSeer Strategy Consultants and PeakXV, beating China’s 7% and the US’ 5% forecast growth rates. That’s why international brands are also rushing into India. In 2023, Japan’s Shiseido-owned NARS Cosmetic signed a distribution partnership with Shoppers Stop Ltd. and Selena Gomez launched her brand Rare Beauty on Sephora India. This year, Rihanna brought her cosmetics line Fenty Beauty to India for the first time on Nykaa. “It is a great time to be in the beauty and personal care sector,” said Abhishek Malhotra, a Mumbai-based partner at McKinsey \u0026 Company. “People have more disposable income, increased awareness and higher aspirations.” Reliance, led by Asia’s richest person, has been diversifying beyond its oil refining roots for years and entering consumer-facing and technology-led businesses. The almost $32 billion Indian beauty and personal care segment is the latest addition to its expanding portfolio that includes mega refineries, a wireless services provider, a streaming platform and Hamleys toy stores. Reliance’s PlaybookTira, which offers brands from American Smashbox and Estee Lauder to Korea’s Sulwhasoo and homegrown newbie Re’equil, is marketed as “slightly premium,” according to Kapadia, who didn’t clarify if Tira will offer heavy discounts to gain market share. Cut-throat pricing that drives out rivals has been Reliance’s playbook across multiple sectors in the past. Reliance, in its December-quarter earnings release, said that Tira delivered a “strong performance across various operating metrics including sales productivity, average bill value,” without sharing revenue or growth numbers. Kapadia says Tire will need to keep innovating to build a significant market share. “What we’ve done so far is bring in these great tech aspects. Obviously some other players are also now picking up on them,” Kapadia said. “So we need to continue pushing the boundary.” Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.",

    "content": "The government is likely to consider addressing the issue of inverted duty structure for certain products like paper, furniture, washing machines, solar glass, and air purifiers to promote domestic manufacturing, an official has said. Inverted duty structure refers to taxation on inputs at higher rates than finished products that result in the build-up of credits and cascading costs. The official said the Commerce and Industry Ministry has shared a list of products with the Finance Ministry to look at the inverted duty structure issues. \"We have already sent the list to the Finance Ministry. The list includes products such as paper, furniture, washing machines, solar glass, air purifiers, and some cases in apparel and jewellery also,\" the official said. Inverted duty structure impacts the domestic industry, as manufacturers have to pay a higher price for raw materials in terms of duty, while the finished products land at lower duty and cost. Expensive inputs make products costly and cannot compete in the export market. In the domestic market, such products are prone to cheaper imports. Addressing this duty issue would help the competitiveness of domestic exporters and that, in turn, will help increase shipments and promote manufacturing.",

    "content": "Wonderla, one of India's biggest theme park companies, sees its upcoming Chennai property giving tough fight to its current best performing park in Bengaluru, thanks to larger and more thrilling rides. Investment in the Chennai park, which is expected to launch in the second quarter of FY26, has increased with the addition of bigger rides. \"We spent Rs 150-160 crore on the Chennai project and the total cost has been revised to Rs 515 crore. Earlier, it was Rs 490 crore but with changes in the park and the kind of attractions we are adding it has gone a little over budget. We are going to have the largest roller coaster in India, an attraction available in parks like Disney and Universal. The cost of the ride is around Rs 70-80 crore,\" said Arun Chittilappilly, Managing Director, (MD), Wonderla. \"Chennai can be as big as Bengaluru. I think it could be our biggest park and should compete with the Bengaluru park for the highest number of footfalls. They (Tamil Nadu) have been demanding a park from Wonderla for the last 20 years, so it was about time we did it,\" the MD said. While it is gearing up to launch the Chennai park, Wonderla is all set to open its new resort in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, later this week.

The company is pursuing leads for projects in other cities like Indore, Greater Noida and Mohali. \"One of these three will get done in a couple of months and we will start working on that as well.\" Past the pressure during the pandemic, when theme parks dealt with full shutdowns and partial reopening leading to losses, Wonderla is now bringing bigger rides and newer thrills. \"We spent around Rs 20-30 crore in existing parks in FY24. Kochi had a lot of investment and we are awaiting a large ride to be installed which cost around Rs 15 crore. It is a ride with a free fall drop from a 40-meter height. We have a new virtual reality ride coming up in Bengaluru which is almost Rs 40 crore investment that is ongoing,\" the MD said. Imagicaa expansion Along with Wonderla, another leading player in the theme park space, Imagicaaworld Entertainment is expanding its park portfolio from three to seven by acquiring a water park and amusement park in Lonavala as well as Shirdi. Its property in Shirdi is a religious theme park called Saiteerth Devotional Theme Park. Also read: Theme parks like Wonderla, Imagicaa see footfalls coming back; resort bookings rise The transaction closure of the acquisition of these properties owned by Giriraj Enterprises has been extended to not later than June 30, 2024, from the earlier expected timeline of April 30, 2024, Imagicaaworld said in an exchange filing. The company also added six new rides at Imagicaa Water Park, Khopoli earlier this month with the total capital expenditure of Rs 12 crore. It expects this expansion to raise the water park’s daily footfall capacity by around 30 percent. Bengaluru resort Wonderla, which saw a dip in revenue and footfalls in the March quarter of FY24 in Bengaluru, witnessed its resort in the city clocking strong metrics. The resort recorded an 18 percent growth in revenue at Rs 4 crore in Q4 FY24 versus Rs 3.4 crore in the same period a year ago. Occupancy increased to 51 percent in Q4 FY24 from 48 percent in Q4 FY23. \"We have a limited inventory of 80 rooms currently, so this year we are roughly making Rs 40 crore investment to add about 40 rooms to the resort which will include cottages, glamping, pods,\" he said. On the other hand, the Bengaluru park's revenue fell 13 percent to Rs 35.9 crore in Q4 FY24 from Rs 41.4 crore in Q4 FY23, while footfalls dropped 10 percent to 2.4 lakh in Q4 FY24 from 2.6 lakh during the same period a year ago. \"Last year our group footfalls were lower, especially in Bengaluru and Kochi, while walk-ins have been good and grown versus the same period a year ago. There was a change in students' exam time, also elections led to some disruptions. In April heatwave affected footfalls but in May we are seeing growth,\" Chittilappilly said.",

He said that the FMCG sector has been recovering with the rural sentiment witnessing an uptick leading to a healthy increase in advertising revenue sequentially as well as on a year-on-year basis. The broadcaster's advertising revenue stood at Rs 1,110.2 crore versus Rs 1,005.8 crore in Q4 FY23.

For a good part of FY24, the liner ad spending environment continued to be soft due to weak pace of recovery in consumption demand for FMCG companies especially due to rural demand slowdown and weak spending among the new age companies. However, post festive season some green shoots emerged led by FMCG starting to inch up their ad spending. The ad spending on GECs (general entertainment channels) has continued to gradually pick up in Q4 FY24,\" said the firm's chief financial officer (CFO), Rohit Gupta. Subscription revenue to grow Goenka said that ad spending is seeing an upward trend in April and May. He expects the industry to see healthy high single digit growth for both subscription and advertising. \"Subscription revenue has also continued to grow at a steady pace, going forward the focus of the players across the industry will be on identifying the avenues to grow the pay TV ecosystem in a healthy manner. We remain hopeful that NTO 3.0 implementation and tariff growth will strengthen the pay TV ecosystem and pave way for sustained growth in subscription revenue,\" Goenka said. Pay TV homes fell to 118 million last year from 120 million the year before, according to an  Ernst \u0026 Young (EY) 2024 report that attributed the fall to cord-cutting and movement to connected TVs at the top end of the market, growth of alternate entertainment options and digital platforms, as well as availability of a sizeable content bouquet for Hindi speaking markets on free television.

The company saw employee layoffs as well as senior level exits in the last few months in the aftermath of the failed merger with Sony which was terminated by the latter earlier this year.

There can be improvements but we didn't need this level of people. We are confident that the team that remains is capable of taking the growth plans forward, Goenka said during the Q4 FY24 earnings call. \"The last few months have been intense as we took several tough decisions in the interest of the company. We have streamlined a strong team across the business. In line with the lateral structure implemented by the company we have entrusted several of our talented team members with higher levels of responsibilities to encourage more cross functional collaboration, quick decision making and ideation,\" the MD said. In March, the company trimmed its Technology \u0026 Innovation Centre's (TIC) workforce by around 50 percent. A month later, the company said in a regulatory filing that in line with Goenka's overall strategic approach, he has \"initiated the process of rationalization of the workforce by 15 percent, that will prune the staff strength across the company to arrive at a streamlined team that is sharply focused on the set goals for the future.\" Among senior level exits, Rahul Johri, who led the revenue and monetization vertical, resigned from the in March, followed by the exit of Nitin Mittal, President, Technology and Data at Zee Entertainment in the same month.

    "content": "India’s biggest ever high-yield rupee corporate bond, held by a number of global private credit funds, is casting a spotlight on pockets of stress within the nation’s credit markets. Some holders of the 143 billion rupee ($1.7 billion) note issued last year by Goswami Infratech Pvt are planning to ask the company for sweeteners in exchange for potentially accepting a company proposal to delay a payment, people familiar with the matter said. Goswami Infratech is an investment company within the Shapoorji Pallonji group under billionaire Shapoor Mistry. Its projects include apartments, warehouses, parking spaces and shops. The company has said it may not be able to pay 14 billion rupees that could come due later this month if certain terms aren’t met, and effectively asked to push that back to later this year. The tussle underscores broader risks posed by payment delays as global private credit investors increasingly wade into emerging markets. India has been among hot spots in Asia, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi—whose party is currently contesting parliamentary elections—has fueled interest by pushing for more infrastructure investment. Private credit investors have been among holders of the Goswami Infratech bond including Cerberus Capital Capital Management LP, Varde Partners LP and Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP. Others have included Canyon Capital, Edelweiss, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered Bank, according to a report by Praxis Global Alliance in April. When Goswami Infratech offered the debt in June last year, money managers flocked to the deal, which offered a juicy 18.75% yield. Of course, such high yields come with bigger risks. The Shapoorji Pallonji group has suffered from liquidity crunches after it piled on debt before the pandemic. That’s forced the engineering and construction conglomerate to attempt to offload assets. The group sold its stake in a key port on the east coast of India called Gopalpur earlier this year to an Adani group company. But that came only after failure to reach such a deal by the end of last year breached a clause in the Goswami Infratech bond that resulted in the borrower having to raise the yield to 20.75%. Another clause, or so-called covenant, in the note stipulates that the Shapoorji Pallonji group must refinance certain debt of its main investment vehicle Sterling Investment Corp. Goswami Infratech said in a letter to the bond trustee earlier this month that the covenant would likely be breached, forcing it to pay creditors the 14 billion rupees, because Shapoorji Pallonji group hasn’t raised new debt for Sterling Investment. The firm said it would then have three business days from May 26 to make that payment, but may not be able to do so. It is seeking holders’ consent to amend the trigger event date to no later than Sept. 30, or as early as when the covenant criteria are met. The investors are going back to their internal investment committees to reach a final decision next week, the people said.",

We believe this could potentially revolutionize the way we administer vaccines, making the process more comfortable for patients and healthcare professionals,\" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said. IntegriMedical's N-FIS has received regulatory approvals from CDSCO (Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation), CE (European regulatory approval) MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program, Australia) and is ISO 13485 certified, the statement said. \"Additionally, the technology is patented in the United States,\" it added. \"This investment is a testament to the potential of our needle-free Injections System technology and its ability to revolutionize drug delivery. SII's expertise in vaccine manufacturing and global distribution will be invaluable as we work towards making our technology more widely accessible to patients worldwide,\" IntegriMedical Managing Director Sarvesh Mutha said. N-FIS will be available in the Indian private market, offering patients and healthcare providers an alternative to traditional needle-based injections, SII said. The technology's advantages include the elimination of needle-phobia, alleviation of pain during administration, convenience of use, and prevention of needle-stick injuries and cross-contamination, it added.",

    "content": "Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund has decided to exclude Adani Ports \u0026 Special Economic Zone Ltd. from its portfolio, citing “unacceptable” risks that the company is tied to human rights violations in war and conflict zones. Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the fund, announced the decision in a statement late on Wednesday. The investor is also excluding US-based L3Harris Technolgies Inc., which develops components for nuclear weapons, and China’s Weichai Power Co., based on concerns it’s contributing to the sale of military equipment to Russia and Belarus. The decision follows recommendations late last year from Norway’s Council on Ethics, which advises the Oslo-based fund. “In a situation in which extremely serious norm violations are taking place, this constitutes an unacceptable risk,” the Council on Ethics said. NBIM responded to a request for comment by referring to the recommendations from the Council on Ethics. The three companies affected by the exclusions didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Aerospace and defense firms, as well as suppliers, have traditionally been widely shunned by ESG investors. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — and the huge gains in the stocks that followed — have more recently led some portfolio managers to reconsider the sector. As of late last year, more than 1,000 ESG funds held stocks in the sector, a roughly 25% increase since Russia’s invasion. To be sure, most ESG fund managers continue to avoid such stocks. At the end of 2023, NBIM owned a 0.79% stake in L3Harris, 0.24% in Adani Ports and 0.13% of Weichai Power. Shares of Adani Ports climbed as much as 2.2% in early trading in Mumbai.",

    "content": "Realty firm Signature Global Ltd has set a target to sell housing properties worth Rs 10,000 crore in 2024-25, up 38 per cent from the last fiscal, as it expects demand for residential assets to remain strong. In its investors presentation, the company has given a guidance of Rs 10,000 crore for sales bookings in the current fiscal. The company's sales bookings more than doubled to Rs 7,268 crore in 2023-24 from Rs 3,430 crore in the preceding year. In terms of area, Signature Global sold 6.18 million square feet in 2023-24, up from 4.35 million square feet in the preceding years. Sales realisation for 2023-24 averaged Rs 11,762 per square feet compared to Rs 7,886 per square feet in the previous fiscal. Pradeep Kumar Aggarwal, Chairman of Signature Global, said, \"The financial year 2023-24 marked a significant period for our company, characterised by several achievements, including a successful IPO, expansion into the premium segment, and a notable transition to mid-income housing from affordable housing.\" He said the company has achieved substantial growth in its presence in the National Capital Region (NCR) leading to an increase in its market share. \"As we move into FY25, our focus will be on risk mitigation and the creation of opportunities to ensure sustainable profitability and long-term value for all stakeholders,\" Aggarwal said. On Wednesday, Signature Global reported a more than 5-fold jump in its consolidated net profit to Rs 41.21 crore for the quarter ended March, driven by higher income. Its net profit stood at Rs 7.60 crore in the year-ago period. Total income increased to Rs 722.73 crore in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year from Rs 709.86 crore in the corresponding period of the preceding year, according to a regulatory filing.

    "description": "Pushpa 2 will be potentially the biggest release of the year, said Ajay Bijli, the company's managing director. PVR Inox is focusing on South India films and sports as new content dries up.  Related stories",
    "content": "Exhibition company PVR Inox's quarter ended March was the weakest of FY24, a year that saw the company experiencing significant volatility in box office collections. It is now betting big on South Indian language films along with alternative content including cricket and concerts. PVR Inox has screened music concerts like Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. \"The box office has been quite slow. April and May have been slow due to the general election. A lot of films have been postponed. Q1 will be a slow quarter. From mid-June, we have decent releases. FY25 is looking good for South Indian films with a big lineup. Last year this segment was muted. Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada are expected to do better this year. For the Hindi box office, we don't have as many big films as we did last year,\" said Nitin Sood, group chief financial officer, PVR Inox. Another focus is on non-film content like the upcoming Men’s T20 World Cup cricket tournament (June 2-29) with PVR Inox looking to screen key matches. The exhibitor had also screened the ICC Men’s World Cup 2023, for which it recorded an average occupancy of over 70 percent and average ticket price of Rs 580. Important games including India versus Pakistan, the India-New Zealand semifinal as well as the final match were sold out. While this kind of non-movie business is a small part of the pie, the multiplex chain is looking to grow this segment amid slow content flow. \"Alternate content is a small proportion and is about 1 percent of overall revenue but we are focused on bringing a lot of alternate content to our screens. We are experimenting with concerts, sports, which are big focus areas,\" said Sood. The exhibitor has also been playing old content due to a weak pipeline of new films, having screened movies like Dune, Oppenheimer and Titanic, alongside Hindi favourites such as Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Jab We Met, Veer-Zaara, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Mohabbatein and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. Earlier this year, PVR Inox had also as part of its alternative content portfolio screened the inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and the Republic Day event, for which it registered 70 percent and 65 percent occupancy, respectively. While year-on-year footfall increased in PVR Inox theatres by around 8 percent in FY24 to 151.4 million from 140.4 million in FY23, across the industry the traffic is down by 25-30 percent. To drive audiences, the company is counting on its revised version of the subscription plan called Passport. \"Under the new Passport subscription plan, we sold 1.75 lakh plans despite film releases being slow. June onwards, with a stronger lineup, this programme will be more meaningful. We are expecting its contribution to be significant in admissions once we have a content lineup in place. Also, out of the total Passports sold, South India's contribution is 35 percent followed by the North market at 32 percent,\" said Sood. Among the key releases expected this year are Chandu Champion and Bhool Bhulaiya 3 starring Kartik Aryan; Kalki 2898 AD starring Prabhas, Deepika Padukone and Amitabh Bachchan; Sitare Zameen Par starring Aamir Khan; Singham Again starring Ajay Devgn; Welcome 2 the Jungle and Sarfira starring Akshay Kumar; Stree 2 starring Shraddha Kapoor and Rajkumar Rao; and Indian 2 starring Kamal Hassan, among others. With the content pipeline expected to stabilise from next month, PVR Inox is expecting better advertising revenue in FY25. \"Ad revenue has direct correlation with the box office because advertisers want to advertise when there are strong footfalls in cinemas. We had a positive trajectory in FY24, and in FY25 we are hoping we will get closer to pre-Covid numbers. Cinema advertising will start taking off from Q2 as Q1 has been a slow quarter,\" Sood said. The company reported Rs 4,51.9 crore in ad revenue in the last financial year, up 18 percent from Rs 3,81.8 crore in FY23.

The company plans to enhance its India-specific product lineups. \"LG Electronics thinking about the Indian market is not one of the important markets, but it is the most important market,\" LG Electronics India Director HE, Brian Jung told PTI. Compared with the European and American TV market where most of the products have moved up to OLED technology, the Indian market is a bit different with LED technology still dominant, he added. \"So, we are trying to deliver our product to the Indian consumer which is a 'picked' product,\" Jung said. He however said the Indian market has witnessed a rapid evolution in terms of screen size and also on technology. \"The Indian market is growing very rapidly and by quantity and by quality,\" he added. LG has market leadership in India in the television segment with 27.1 per cent, he said, adding that the brand is loved by consumers in the country \"especially in the home entertainment category and we will keep to uphold it.\" The Indian television market is estimated to be around Rs 28,000 crore annually. When asked about the growth outlook, LG Electronics India Business Head, Home Entertainment Abhiral Bhansali said, \"Last year was also good for us. This year we are targeting roughly about 25 to 30 per cent growth versus last year.\" In the HE segment, the company clocked revenue of Rs 8,000 crore last year.

The United States and Australia have also been looking into contamination after Hong Kong suspended sales of three spice blends of MDH and one of Everest in April, saying they contained high levels of a cancer-causing pesticide, ethylene oxide. Singapore ordered a recall of the Everest spice mix. MDH on April 28, assured consumers that its products are entirely safe and refuted the accusations made by food regulators in Hong Kong and Singapore of pesticide presence in certain items. \"Ethylene oxide is a chemical known to cause cancer in humans, and its use for food sterilisation has been phased out in New Zealand and other countries.

Regulators in India have inspected MDH and Everest plants and sent samples for testing after the global scrutiny, though the results have not yet been made public. The inspections aim to evaluate whether the products sold by these companies adhere to the standards established by FSSAI, sources revealed to CNBC-TV18.

    "content": "BlackRock Inc, the world's largest fund manager, is looking to raise its share in India's $500 billion pool of fully investible government bonds via recently launched exchange traded funds (ETFs), a fixed income strategist at the firm said. These bonds, which have been placed under a Fully Accessible Route (FAR) and have no foreign investment limits, will be included in JPMorgan's emerging market debt index starting June and have been drawing interest from foreign money managers. Globally, ETFs hold about 2% of outstanding bonds, said Hui Sien Koay, lead index, fixed income strategist for APAC at BlackRock, in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. \"If we consider that as a barometer, and the total (India) FAR bond market size, it stands at around $500 billion, which is our opportunity set, and if we consider 2% of that, it would be a realistic commercial goal for us (as an industry),\" she said. BlackRock launched its India bond ETF in February and currently has $26 million of assets under management in this fund. The ETF has the cheapest fee among peers, with a weighted average yield of 7.14%, according to latest disclosures. BlackRock has expertise in \"tricky markets\" like India and helps investors work through issues such as trade execution and minimisation of tax, said Koay. \"I think we do have an edge due to this.\" India's entry into global bond indices was discussed for nearly a decade but issues such restrictions on foreign investors and local taxation delayed it. Over the next eight months, Indian bonds will be included in JPMorgan and Bloomberg's emerging market debt indices, but the FTSE Russell is yet to include domestic bonds. The inclusion comes against a favorable macroeconomic backdrop with the Indian economy seeing high growth, a stable currency and relatively higher yields. India \"stands out\" with yields higher than any other BBB-rated country, Koay said. \"Since the rupee has been relatively stable, we are quite sanguine about it, because it has got a lot of tailwinds, so we are bullish for now (on India),\" she said. BlackRock is drawing investors using marketing campaigns offering investment options across asset classes. \"The marketing campaign is focused on India as one of the main priority themes for this year,\" Koay said.",

    "content": "The share of coal in India's total power generation capacity dipped below 50 percent in the first quarter of 2024, the first time since the 1960s. The latest POWERup quarterly report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) showed that renewable energy accounted for 71.5 percent of the record 13,669 megawatts (MW) power generation capacity added by India in the first quarter (January-March) of this year. Coal's share, including lignite, in India's total power generation capacity dropped below 50 percent for the first time since the 1960s. The decline in coal's share of power generation capacity mirrors a global trend, with demand for coal in G7 countries hitting record lows in 2023, levels not seen since 1900. To accelerate the transition, G7 countries pledged last month to phase out all unabated coal power generation by 2035, building on their commitment to halt all construction of new coal-fired power plants. The term \"unabated\" generally refers to the continued use of coal, oil, and gas without efforts to curtail emissions. At the United Nations' COP28 climate change conference in December last year, world leaders reached a historic agreement to transition away from planet-warming fossil fuels and triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030. According to the report, a record 69 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy tenders were issued in India in the fiscal year (FY) 2023-24, surpassing the central government's target of 50 GW per year. \"After a downturn from 2019 to 2022 due to supply-chain issues and global price spikes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the market has rebounded and gone from strength to strength,\" Vibhuti Garg, Director - South Asia, IEEFA, said. India has risen to third place in the world's solar power generation rankings, trailing only China and the US, according to Ember's fifth annual Global Electricity Review of 80 countries. Ranked ninth in 2015, India has now overtaken Japan, which, along with fellow G7 member Germany, has a persistently high demand for coal. Solar power generated a record 5.5 percent of global electricity in 2023, with India generating 5.8 percent of its electricity from solar last year. Solar remained the world's fastest-growing electricity source for the 19th consecutive year in 2023, adding more than twice as much new electricity worldwide as coal. India witnessed the world's fourth-largest increase in solar generation in 2023 (+18 terawatt hour or TWh), behind China (+156 TWh), the United States (+33 TWh), and Brazil (+22 TWh). Together, the top four solar growth countries accounted for 75 percent of growth in 2023. Solar's contribution to electricity generation in India surged from 0.5 percent in 2015 to 5.8 percent in 2023. According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) \"Net Zero Emissions\" scenario, solar would make up 22 percent of global electricity generation by 2030. Given that electricity generation accounts for nearly half of India's annual carbon dioxide emissions (1.18 gigatonnes in 2023), accelerating the transition to cleaner generation sources is crucial for the country to meet both its developmental and climate goals. The IEA says tripling global renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency are essential to limit the average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a political target set in 2015 to prevent further worsening of climate impacts. India is among the few countries aiming to triple renewable capacity by 2030.",

    "content": "Multiplex major PVR Inox has listed down four priority areas with improving profitability topping the list and for this it is cutting down its capital expenditure (capex) on new screens. After spending a total capex of Rs 620 crore in FY24, the company will bring it down by 25 percent to Rs 450 crore in FY25, said Nitin Sood, group chief financial officer of PVR Inox. \"Over the last 12-18 months, we have repositioned a lot of our existing contracts and have got significant developer contributions to fund part of the growth. We have also renegotiated some of our rentals in most of the new locations that have opened up. We eventually want to evolve into a capex-light model and reduce our capex by 30-50 percent,\" he said. \"Bulk of the new additions are already under fit-out from previous year. So, FOCO will gain momentum in the coming year and take about four years to become a dominant model. In the next year you could see 20-25 percent (screens) in the capital light and FOCO model,\" Sood said. Also, out of the new screens many will open down south as it is focusing to expand more in the southern states. He also added that with screen additions slowly moving to asset light models, capex reduction will take some time to reach the 30-50 percent range. \"As we roll out a new screen portfolio, our landlord partners will co-invest for most of the screens. We will end up sharing food business with the landlord so increasingly more and more deals pivot to higher percentage of revenue sharing as compared to investing upfront capital.\" In FY24, PVR Inox opened 130 new screens and shut down 85 screens with net additions of 45 screens. The exhibitor will shut down around 70 screens with net additions of 50-60 screens in FY25. The CFO said that screen closures will be a constant exercise. \"Most of the assets have lived their life. Also, the malls in which the cinemas which are being closed are not performing because of which we are looking at the closures.\" The company is also renegotiating existing contracts for operating sites but Sood expects marginal reduction in rent and CAM (Common Area Maintenance) charges. \"We are in discussion with landlords. Where the lock in period is expiring there we have an opportunity to renegotiate rentals but it will not be a large number. Some of the rental cost will get rationalised as we come out of lock in period,\" Sood said. PVR Inox's expense on rent increased 14 percent to Rs 1,192.8 crore in FY24 from Rs 1,042.6 crore in FY23. CAM expenses were up 15 percent to Rs 329.6 crore in the last financial year from Rs 286.9 crore in FY23. \"We will be transitioning to a capital-light growth model for new screen additions. We will be selective in adding new cinema and prioritise expansion efforts in South India. We will monetise Inox real estate inherited from the merger and plan to use the proceeds to reduce debt. Currently, screen portfolio stands at 1,748 screens,\" said Ajay Bijli, managing director of PVR Inox Ltd, in the Q4 FY24 earnings call. The company's net debt reduced by Rs 136.4 crore in FY24 to Rs 1,294 crore from Rs 1,430.4 crore in FY23.

    "content": "India's largest multiplex operator PVR Inox is expanding its food and beverage (F\u0026B) business by venturing into pre-ticketed food business, which means the company wants a share of consumers' wallets before they buy a movie ticket. While one of the biggest contributors to the company's overall revenue is the F\u0026B segment, bulk of the revenue is from post-ticketed F\u0026B business. To grow its pre-ticketed F\u0026B segment, the exhibitor under a joint venture (JV) with QSR (quick service restaurant) chain Devyani International will open five to six food courts in the first year of launching the new entity. \"We will set up a JV in which Devyani will own 51 percent (share) and PVR Inox will own the remaining. The idea is to open food courts in shopping malls all over the country. Priority will be to open in present large shopping malls,\" Nitin Sood, Group CFO (Chief Financial Officer), PVR Inox, told Moneycontrol. \"It (online sales) is a small percentage, less than 1 percent. Most of the F\u0026B sales are in cinemas. Online segment hasn't done well for us. I think we need to redo that business model. We are reworking that model,\" Sood said. The multiplex operator is looking to pivot from being only an exhibition company to being an F\u0026B player as well, said PVR Inox's Managing Director Ajay Bijli during Q4 FY24 earnings call. What will be on the menu? Sood said that the contribution in terms of food menu will be limited from PVR Inox and it will be largely driven by Devyani International's brands. \"New brands can also come in and join exclusively for the food court business. The idea is that Devyani brings food brands to the table and we bring real estate. There is an opportunity in this space for an organised player to operate.\" Sood said that opening food courts is one of the initiatives that the exhibitor is taking in the overall scheme of expanding pre-ticketed F\u0026B. \"Post ticketed F\u0026B is large at around Rs 2,000 crore. This (opening food court) will be a small fraction of that and it will take time to build up,\" the CFO added. Bijli said that they were keen to pivot to pre-ticketed F\u0026B especially with Devyani International bringing in brands like KFC, Pizza Hut, Costa Coffee. \"We have a long term relationship with them (Devyani International) as they have been our suppliers for Pepsi in most of our circuits for a long time. We see a lot of opportunities with this JV because most of the malls do not have branded food courts and in existing malls food courts are not managed well. Food courts and cinema are the two anchors in every mall that generate the maximum footfalls. Having a play in this with Devyani is a good strategic pivot for the company (PVR Inox),\" the MD said.

    "content": "Popular Indian spice brand MDH, under scrutiny for alleged contamination in some products, has since 2021 seen an average 14.5% of its U.S. shipments rejected due to the presence of bacteria, a Reuters analysis of U.S. regulatory data found. Hong Kong suspended sales last month of three spice blends made by MDH and one by another Indian company, Everest, for apparently containing high levels of a cancer-causing pesticide. Ethylene oxide is unfit for human consumption and a cancer risk with long exposure. The companies have said their products are safe and MDH added it does not use ethylene oxide at any stage of storing, processing, or packing of spices. Authorities in the United States, Australia and India are looking into the matter. Both brands are popular in India and are exported around the world. Before the latest scrutiny, products from MDH, a family-run Indian company more than 100 years old, were rejected for sale in the United States due to the presence of salmonella, a bacteria that can lead to gastrointestinal illness. Around 20%, or 13 of MDH's 65 shipments to the United States were rejected after it failed checks for salmonella between October 2023 - when the current fiscal year started - and May 3, according to the latest available data compiled by Reuters from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA did not state what quantity was contained in each shipment but the 13 shipments rejected included mixed spices and seasonings, as well as fenugreek, according to the data. In fiscal 2022-23, about 15% of 119 MDH shipments were rejected mostly for salmonella contamination, while the rejections stood at 8.19% during 2021-22, the data showed. Everest has had fewer rejections in the United States with just one of 450 shipments in the ongoing 2023-24 year having been rejected so far for salmonella. Around 3.7% of Everest's U.S. shipments were halted in 2022-23 and there were no rejections in the 189 shipments to the U.S. the year before, the data showed. In response to queries on the FDA data, an MDH spokesperson said its products are safe. Everest said it had an 'exceptional' rejection rate of its U.S. shipments of less than 1% in fiscal 2023-2024, adding that their products are safe. The U.S. FDA and the Spices Board did not respond to requests for comment. The Board has been inspecting MDH and Everest facilities for compliance with quality standards, but the results have not yet been made public. For decades, MDH and Everest have been among the biggest spice makers in India, making products widely used in home kitchens and restaurants for flavouring curries and many dishes. In 2019, a few batches of MDH's spice mix were taken off the shelves in the U.S. for salmonella contamination and in 2023, the FDA recalled a few of Everest's products over similar findings and issued a public health alert.",

    "content": "For decades, India's spice makers MDH and Everest have been ubiquitous in kitchens around the world with their products being essential ingredients in chicken and fish curries and vegetable dishes. A Hong Kong sales ban on some of their products after a cancer-causing pesticide was found has triggered a wave of scrutiny, including in the United States, the Maldives, India and Australia. Both brands say their products are safe. Here are some facts and background on the two brands: * New Delhi-based MDH started in 1919 and is a family-run business. * It rose to popularity with ads and packaging featuring its founder Dharampal Gulati who sported a handlebar moustache and a turban. Gulati, often dubbed as India's \"Spice King\", died in 2020. * MDH's website says it has 62 products. It deals in grounded spices, as well as spice blends which were created after \"decades of research\". * MDH has five factories and its products are sold in India and markets such as Australia, the United States, Europe, Canada and the United Kingdom through a network of more than 400,000 retail dealers. * MDH's revenue for 2022-2023 stood at $260 million. EVEREST * Everest Food Products started in 1967 with three products. Its founder Vadilal Bhai Shah started his business from a small 200 square feet spice shop. * With 52 products, Everest today has global presence in around 80 countries, including in North America, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia Pacific and Africa. * Some 20 million households use Everest products every day and 3.7 billion packs of its products are sold each year, according to its website. Around 620,000 outlets sell Everest products in 1,000 small towns and cities of India. * India's Bollywood stars Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan are Everest brand ambassadors, appearing together in many TV commercials to promote its products, especially those to make the famous rice dish, biryani. * Everest's net sales for 2022-23 stood at $365 million.",

    "content": "TVS Motor Company expects electric vehicles to account for 25-30 per cent of its total two-wheeler sales in the next two to three years, said Managing Director Sudarshan Venu. The company is betting big on electric mobility and may even look at electric bicycle and cargo three-wheelers, to have a full range of products. They had earlier reiterated its commitment to invest Rs 5,000 crore towards design, development and deployment of future technologies, products, and digital capabilities. EV Outlook Venu said TVS will bring another electric scooter this year to add to its existing portfolio of iQube and TVS X, while asserting that the company's EV presence will be across both scooters and motorcycle segments. In FY24, the company's EV sales grew by 101 percent at 1.94 lakh units as against 97,000 units during 2022-23. TVS sold 19.9 lakh units of motorcycles and 15.7 lakh scooters. For electric motorcycles, he referred to the 'TVS Racing Electric One Make Championship' for which the company developed TVS Apache RTE (Racing Throttle Electric) race motorcycles as a sign of things to come in the segment.

We will have a full range of products,\" he said. He added that electric three-wheelers have a huge opportunity and it would grow fast particularly in urban areas. Venu further added that as e-commerce and logistics improve there is a greater opportunity for three-wheeler cargo applications in addition to passenger applications for both EV and CNG. When asked about future investments for EV, Venu said, \"We have already announced investments and we will continue to build this business. The investment momentum that you have seen in the last few years from our side will continue going into the future as well.\" With the battery technology rapidly evolving, he said TVS has partnered with \"the best globally on the cell side to ensure that we give the best option to customers each year\". The company has been focussing on in-house development of a slew of technologies for electric vehicles, he said, adding while a large number of engineers have been committed to EV, it would also continue to strengthen in software, analytics, digital and AI going forward. Sudarshan Venu, son of Venu Srinivasan, took over the post of  Managing Director in May 2022. TVS Motor Company saw its fourth-quarter net profit rise 18 percent to Rs 485 crore in the March quarter, aided by robust volumes, healthy product mix, better pricing and benign commodity costs.

    "content": "The operations of Air India Express slowly started improving on Friday as more cabin crew members are joining back for duty, after significant flight disruptions caused by cabin crew strike that has been called off. The strike by a section of the cabin crew since Tuesday night that resulted in the cancellation of more than 170 flights was called off on Thursday evening and the airline also withdrew termination letters issued to 25 striking cabin crew. The Tata Group airline, which operates around 380 flights daily, has curtailed operations in the wake of the strike and the official on Friday said, normalcy is expected in the next two days. The official also said that most international flights are in the evening time and the operations on that front are expected to be better from Friday onwards with the availability of more cabin crew. On average, the airline operates 120 international flights and 260 domestic services daily while there are fewer flights on some days. Faced with cabin crew shortage, Air India Express on Thursday cancelled 85 flights or around 23 per cent of its total daily capacity. After the strike was called off on Thursday, the airline had said it will help to swiftly restore flight schedule and also apologised to passengers who were impacted by the flight disruptions. Many cabin crew members had reported sick to protest against alleged mismanagement at the airline and lack of equality in treatment of staff. Air India Express -- which is in the process of completing the merger of AIX Connect, formerly AirAsia India, with itself -- has around 6,000 employees, including over 2,000 cabin crew.",

    "content": "India will again delay caps on market share for a popular digital payments method, two sources told Reuters, benefiting Google Pay and Walmart-backed PhonePe as the authorities prioritise growth over concerns about market concentration. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the quasi-regulator, will extend by as much as two years a year-end deadline to cap at 30% the market share of any company processing payments via the Unified Payment Interface (UPI), the sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. PhonePe's share of UPI payments has risen to 48.3% from 37% in April 2020, while Google Pay's share has declined to 37.4% from 44%, according to NPCI data. The two processed a combined 11.5 billion transactions in April, the data showed. India launched UPI in 2016 but barred companies from charging for the instant digital payments service in an effort to promote online transactions and reduce the use of cash in Asia's third-largest economy. Because they cannot charge for it, India's banks and others like Meta-owned WhatsApp and Amazon Pay have not pushed UPI-based payments aggressively, leaving authorities worried about a concentration risk. While their apps do not earn money from the payments, PhonePe and Google Pay have been able to use their UPI customer base to sell services such as loans and insurance. NPCI, which has a regulatory mandate from the central bank, announced the 30% cap in 2020 but later extended the deadline by two years to the end of 2024. The deadline will have to be extended again, said one of the sources, as it is not possible for PhonePe and Google Pay to reduce their market shares without hurting UPI payments growth. A final decision on the extension will be communicated closer to the deadline, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because they are not allowed to speak to the media. NPCI had hoped for more competition when WhatsApp was permitted to offer UPI-based payments in February 2020, but the company had just 0.2% market share as of April. India's Paytm, with the third-highest share, has experienced a decline in payments processed through its platforms after regulators placed curbs on a group entity. Payment firms want the market-share cap removed, asking NPCI to let them charge for UPI payments to encourage competition, said an official at a payment company. The government will decide whether to allow firms to charge for UPI payments, the two sources said, but one said NPCI does not favour removing the share cap. The volume of UPI transactions rose 49.5% in April from a year earlier, less than the 54% rise logged March. The central bank met on Tuesday with industry executives to brainstorm on ways to expand the UPI user base, which was about 300 million users and 50 million merchants late last year, according to the most recent data.",

Fitch Ratings has affirmed India-based Axis Bank and ICICI Bank's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BB+', the global agency said in two separate rating commentaries. Fitch has also affirmed the banks' Government Support Rating (GSR) at 'bb+' and Viability Rating (VR) at 'bb'. The agency said its expectation of a supportive operative environment is on account of India's robust medium-term growth potential. Fitch expects GDP growth of 7 per cent in 2024 and 6.5 per cent in 2025, supported by investment prospects. \"The economy has been resilient as healthy business sentiment, steady financial markets and the government's capital spending buffered global economic headwinds and inflation. These factors are conducive for banks to sustain profitable business, provided risks are well-managed,\" Fitch said. With regard to Axis Bank, Fitch said the bank's appetite for growth is likely to remain above the sector average, albeit similar to other large private banks. \"We have revised the outlook on Axis' earnings and profitability score to stable, from positive, as we do not see a significant further upside to the core metric from current levels, despite remaining high relative to the years before FY23,\" it added. On ICICI Bank, Fitch said it maintains a positive outlook on its earnings and profitability score, as it expects profitability to remain elevated relative to prior years. On ICICI Bank's large domestic franchise, Fitch said the bank has a strong retail-focused domestic franchise as India's second-largest private bank. \"This, together with above-average capitalisation, should support sustained generation of revenue and business opportunities as well as market-share expansion through the cycle,\" it added.",

    "content": "Sebi on Monday restrained 12 entities, including Add-Shop E-Retail Ltd and White Organic Agro Ltd, as well as their promoters — Dineshbhai Pandya and Darshak Rupani — from securities markets for flouting regulatory norms. The regulator also barred Dineshbhai Pandya, Dev Pandya, Jayshree Pandya, Deviben Pandya, Jigar Pandya, Prashantt Rupani, Darshak Rupani, Jitendra Mehta and Ronak Desai from acting as key managerial personnel of any public company, which intends to raise money from the public, including Dada Organic Ltd, till further orders. Also, Sebi directed Add-Shop E-Retail Ltd (ASERL) and White Organic Agro Ltd (WOAL) to constitute new audit committees with enhanced oversight of related party transactions. \"I find that after the investigation by Sebi, examining various complex sets of information and documents, has made out a prima facie case that the published financial statements of ASERL and WOAL, which are listed companies, were manipulated,\" Sebi's whole time member Ashwani Bhatia said in the interim order. Sebi also found that Dada Organics Ltd (DOL) was prima facie involved in fictitious transactions with ASERL and WOAL, thereby enabling to book fictitious purchase and sale transactions in their books of account. It was observed that in May 2023, DOL had filled its IPO papers with the stock exchange to raise money. However, it was withdrawn later by the company. Hence, the possibility of ASERL, WOAL or DOL raising capital in the future cannot be ruled out, unless stopped, as per the Sebi order. \"What has clearly emerged through the investigation done by Sebi, including the data relating to the change in shareholding pattern of ASERL, is the fact that the promoters of the company did everything to benefit themselves at the cost of small shareholders. \"New retail investors whose number increased to 46,884 in March 23 from a mere 96 as on March 20 were led up the garden path. Promoters of ASERL, while busy making false and misleading announcements, artificially pumped up ASERL's sales to show a healthy top-line and bottom-line,\" Bhatia said. \"The company in reality was not manufacturing or producing any agricultural product, but simply passing fictitious sales transactions between its related parties. \"The promoters gave the impression of a healthy and well-run company and benefitted themselves through the falsehood. This appears to be a classic example of a pump and dump scheme and small investors need to be cautious of such fraudulent activities in their own interest,\" Bhatia added. The order came after Sebi received complaints in September 2023 and December 2021 against ASERL and WOAL alleging irregularities pertaining to related party transactions, fake announcements regarding supply orders etc. Thereafter, Sebi initiated an investigation into the affairs of both the companies for the period April 2020 to March 2023. The focus of the probe was to ascertain possible violations of the provisions of PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) and disclosure rules. ASERL is into the business of manufacturing, marketing and distribution of Ayurveda products. Dineshbhai Pandya is the promoter of ASERL and DOL. WOAL is engaged in the business of organic food items, while Darshak Rupani is the MD of the firm. Meanwhile, Sebi also issued show cause notices to seven other entities for alleged violation of PFUTP and disclosure norms.",

The debt’s tenor could range from three to five years, with the pricing likely linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, they said. The port-to-power group is discussing the planned transaction with lenders including Credit Agricole, DBS Bank Ltd., BNP Paribas, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., and Mizuho Bank Ltd., two of the people said. Adani is likely to conclude the borrowing in the next two months. The conglomerate is regaining the confidence of investors since being targeted early last year by US short seller Hindenburg Research. In March, the group saw robust demand for its first public bond sale since the shortseller crisis. Adani Total is an equal venture between Adani and TotalEnergies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is trying to increase the country’s ability to import LNG to lift the share of natural gas in its energy mix to 15% by 2030 from about 7% now. The move is to help lower the dependence on dirtier fossil fuels, such as coal and oil.",

    "content": "The Asian Development Bank is open to funding the space sector in India in addition to focusing on climate finance to mitigate the associated risks, said its Vice President Bhargav Dasgupta on Friday. ADB has done some projects in satellite in the Asia Pacific region, but has not provided any assistance in the Indian space sector. \"We have not done much till now. We are always open to look at new areas...we understand it has been opened up and there is lot of interest on startup side...if we find alignment with our objectives in terms of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we will look at it,\" he said. Talking about initiatives in India, Dasgupta said, \"we are very excited about the work that is happening in the country including recently launched rooftop solar projects, large solar projects, pump hydro, and battery storage. We are talking to many sponsors in these segment and we will be happy to see how many of them we can finance.\" Besides, he said there is a lot of interest in the corporate sector in energy transmission, conversion of older coal-fired power projects into green energy units. Dasgupta, former MD and CEO of ICICI Lombard, was appointed Vice President of ADB in September last year. He is responsible for management of ADB's Private Sector Operations Department and Office of Markets Development and Public Private Partnerships. ADB, established in 1966, is owned by 68 members, 49 from the region. It is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. India, a founding member of ADB, is now ADB's fourth largest shareholder and its top borrower since 2010.",

    "content": "The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday opposed the interim medical bail sought by Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal in a money laundering case and said his stay at a private hospital could be extended for a month. Goyal has sought interim bail on medical and humanitarian grounds, citing that both he and his wife, Anita Goyal, suffered from cancer. On Friday, a single bench of Justice N J Jamadar said it would pass orders on May 6. Goyal had last week moved the high court seeking interim bail on merits and release on medical grounds. While Goyal's counsel, Harish Salve, urged the court to consider the case on humanitarian grounds, the ED's counsel, Hiten Venegaonkar, vehemently opposed the bail and said the probe agency did not have a problem if his hospitalisation was extended. Before closing the matter for orders, Justice Jamadar remarked that taking treatment without restraint would make a difference. \"There is a distinction when a person gets medical treatment without any restraint,\" he said. To which Venegaonkar said there was no restraint even now. \"He is getting treated at a hospital of his choice and by doctors of his own choice. His wife is also in the same hospital, and there is no restraint for them to meet and spend time together,\" Venegaonkar said. The lawyer said the court may extend his hospitalisation for four weeks and then call for a fresh medical report to assess his situation. Salve argued that apart from his deteriorating physical health, Goyal's mental health was also not good. \"His mental health is also a point of concern. Being mentally infirm is worse than physical infirmity,\" Salve said. The senior counsel said section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) is strict on grant of bail to persons arrested for a financial crime. \"But there is a proviso under the section, which says bail may be considered in cases of old age or infirmity. This proviso makes this section more humane,\" Salve said. The court may grant interim bail to Goyal and impose the strictest conditions on him, he said. \"He (Goyal) has been told his wife has only six months to live as she has terminal cancer. He has also got cancer. His mental state and his wife's mental state need to be considered. At this stage, they both need love and affection,\" Salve said. The ED arrested Goyal in September 2023 on allegations that he had laundered money and siphoned off loans to the tune of Rs 538.62 crore given to Jet Airways by Canara Bank. His wife, Anita Goyal, was arrested in November 2023 when the ED submitted its charge sheet in the case. She was granted bail by the special court on the same day, considering her age and medical condition.",

    "description": "With brands such as Chivas Regal, Glenlivet and Absolut vodka, Pernod has a share of 17% in a liquor market it says is its second biggest globally by net sales, but one where it is embroiled in licence, tax and antitrust difficulties.Indian antitrust regulator checks if Pernod colluded with New Delhi retailersRelated stories",
    "content": "India's competition watchdog is reviewing accusations that France's Pernod Ricard colluded with retailers in New Delhi to boost market share, the latest headache for the spirits giant in a key market, legal papers seen by Reuters show. With brands such as Chivas Regal, Glenlivet and Absolut vodka, Pernod has a share of 17% in a liquor market it says is its second biggest globally by net sales, but one where it is embroiled in licence, tax and antitrust difficulties. The latest accusations figure in a confidential filing in March on practices in the liquor industry made by an individual identified only by the first name Mohit, who has a record of taking up public interest litigations. Pernod is accused of gaining market share by asking retailers in the Indian capital to stock more of its goods in return for helping them secure loans to bid for store licences, according to the filing. Reuters reviewed the filing, which is not public, in line with the watchdog's rules. In a statement to Reuters, Pernod said it had not been notified of the new antitrust case, but was committed to comply with local laws and \"instruct and educate our teams\" to do the same. The competition regulator did not reply to Reuters' queries. Telephone calls to the complainant went unanswered. The accusations rely mostly on findings by India's financial crime agency, the Enforcement Directorate, as it looks into Pernod's alleged role in a graft case centred on the city's liquor policy that led to the 2022 arrest of a company official. Drawing on the findings, the CCI complaint accuses Pernod of providing $24 million in corporate guarantees to its bankers in 2021 to help city retailers get loans. Retailers then ensured that 35% of the stock in their shops consisted of Pernod brands. The findings \"clearly spill the beans that the purpose of the corporate guarantee was cartelisation by Pernod with selected retailers for brand pushing at the expense of fair competition,\" the case document states. Among Pernod's other woes, it has, for more than a year, unsuccessfully sought a retail licence for its products in New Delhi. It faces another antitrust case for misconduct in south India and is contesting a tax demand for nearly $250 million, for allegedly undervaluing imports. Pernod has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in all the cases. The latest CCI case centres on Enforcement Directorate findings that Pernod's acting chief financial officer for India consented in mid-2021 to the issuance of corporate guarantees for facilitating loans to Delhi retailers, and advised the group CFO, Helene de Tissot, of it in an email on July 13, 2021. Pernod's \"support\" of $24 million to bidders for store licences had the potential to generate an additional $15 million \"benefit over a three-year period\" and the move \"will also enable us to counter local players' threat\", the email said. The CCI case also cites extracts of a Pernod PowerPoint presentation in June 2021 that mentioned an internal plan to \"take control of retail shops\" in New Delhi. Reuters has previously reported the email and the presentation.",

Accenture analysed publicly available employee data to estimate the impact of generative AI on banking tasks. The company modelled the financial implications for over 150 large banks globally, including Indian public and private sector banks, over a three-year period. \"Banks that move quickly to scale generative AI across their organisations could increase their revenues by up to 600 bps (basis points) in three years,\" the research revealed. \"Operating income could increase by around 20 per cent, while return on equity levels could rise by 300 bps...By helping banks operate more efficiently, the technology could lead to 1-2 per cent in cost savings, with cost-to-income ratios declining by up to 400 bps,\" the study further said. Accenture said banks will need to optimise the usage of their generative AI applications and upskill existing employees while attracting specialized AI and data talent to support the scaling and operationalization of the technology. It said 41 per cent of all banking occupation have a high potential for automation. \"To unlock generative AI's full potential, banks in India need to adopt a holistic and long-term strategy such that it integrates into their value chains.

    "description": "PVR Inox is running offers on food and beverages as well as movie tickets in a bid to increase footfalls at a time when admissions and occupancies are decreasing due to a weak content pipeline in theatres.PVR Inox has launched offers to make movie tickets as well as F\u0026B more affordable in their cinemas.  Related stories",
    "content": "India's top multiplex chain PVR Inox is often asked two questions — why popcorn in their cinemas is expensive? And will movie ticket prices get cheaper? The company recently launched its ad-free content for the big screen amid decreasing footfalls which continue to be around 25-30 percent lower than pre-Covid levels. While the offer caught the attention of the cinema going audience, many said that it is the high cost of food and beverage (F\u0026B) as well as expensive movie tickets which is resulting in limited footfalls in their cinemas. One social media user said, \"Ads in movies were annoying, but I think the food cost is the main reason why people have reduced.\" When Moneycontrol raised people's concerns to PVR Inox, the company  listed down four points on what it is doing to change the perception of the expensive F\u0026B and movie tickets in their cinemas. The company last year started running the offer of free refills for popcorn and Pepsi. \"We have never refilled our hero products, which are popcorn and Pepsi. But we went ahead and did that to change the perception of people that F\u0026B is expensive in cinemas. So, there is unlimited refill for popcorn and Pepsi under a large combo available which if one buys they can fill up as many times as they want. People even fill it up on their way out of cinemas. For every one combo sold, we are getting 1.6 times refill on an average,\" Gautam Dutta PVR INOX, Co-CEO, said. Another offer the company is running is four to five items in every PVR Inox cinema available at flat Rs 99 from Monday to Thursday. Also read: PVR Inox to launch movie subscription plan to drive new audience in cinemas On July 12 last year PVR Inox announced a slash in prices of snacks at its counters, after a customer tweeted that the high F\u0026B prices at multiplexes had made movie-going unaffordable. Post-Covid F\u0026B prices have gone up by 30 percent as compared to the pre-Covid period. On the other hand, content quality is going down currently and this is hitting footfalls. Analysts point out that high F\u0026B prices are testing the affordability of the Indian consumer, overall affecting the frequency of cinemagoers. In the nine months of FY24, PVR Inox reported an 11 percent increase in F\u0026B  spend per head up to Rs 133 from Rs 120 during the same period in FY23. Revenue from the sale of food and beverages increased 22 percent in nine months of FY24 to Rs 1,545.2 crore from Rs 1,265.9 crore in FY23. Movie ticket offers: Passport, flash sale But what about movie tickets? They are expensive too. Dutta is betting big on movie passports, a type of subscription plan for the big screen content. It is available in two types — a monthly plan at Rs 349 valid Monday to Thursday allowing four visits to the cinema under which the cost of watching a movie in a theatre comes to about Rs 87 while the other is a quarterly plan at Rs 1,047 allowing 12 visits. \"Out of the five lakh footfalls coming in a month, I know that four lakh are coming because of the passport and the remaining one lakh would in any way have come. The additional 4 lakh admissions will have an impact on F\u0026B revenue and advertising in cinema. Also, this is taking away the pricing friction,\" Dutta said. As many as 1.5 lakh passports in its new version have been sold in three to four weeks. Last year in October the company launched passports for Rs 699 a month plan, offering 10 movies at Rs 70 each for weekdays. \"The first version of the passport we came up with was Rs 699 for 10 visits which was later revised because the consumer said that 10 times is too much. Last time, we sold 21,000 passports. This time, we have opened it for the south region as well. We have also brought in an add-on which lets a consumer upgrade the passport to a recliner for Rs 150 which will give access to formats like IMAX, 4DX, 3XL,\" said the Co-CEO, adding that plans like passports encourage consumers to come more often to cinemas. Also read: PVR Inox looks to drive up business of smaller films with movie passport launch Footfalls in PVR Inox increased 8 percent in the nine months of FY24 at 11.88 crore, up from 11 crore in FY23, according to the company's Q3 and 9M Fy24 investor presentation. Sales of movie tickets in FY24 increased 23 percent at Rs 2,644.6 crore from Rs 2,149.8 crore in FY23. The company is also running a flash sale for cinema tickets. \"We have branded it as a cinema lovers day and it offers a movie at Rs 99 on a Friday. We start advertising it on Thursday. This gives me four times more footfalls on a specific day. On average on a Friday I get about 3-4 lakh people, I can multiply that by 3.5-4 times due to the sale. We get 20 lakh admissions in a year by having about seven weeks of cinema lovers day promotion,\" he said. There has been an increase of around 10-15 percent in movie ticket prices over pre-Covid levels, according to experts tracking the cinema business. High movie ticket prices along with weak content has been a double whammy for the film industry. India most affordable for movies However, Dutta said that movie watching in India is the most affordable when compared to the western counterparts. \"In India for a chain like PVR Inox, the (movie ticket) pricing is $3 and you can go to at least 50 cinemas in various territories and watch a movie under Rs 150. Now, where in this entire world will you be able to watch a movie in an air conditioned environment for less than $2? asked Dutta, adding that international markets like the US and the UK are all operating at $14-18 for a movie ticket. When it comes to F\u0026B, Dutta said that when the core product which is film is kept under check then some items of the cinema business have to take the brunt of the rental, electricity, and employee costs. \"There are 24,000 employees in the company. My electricity cost each day is Rs 1 crore. The kind of repair and maintenance that is required with 10 lakh people coming into a cinema every time over the weekend imagine the wear and tear that happens on the seats, and ACs. The cinemas run 20 hours a day for 365 days. My projector costs more than Rs 2 lakh,\" he said. PVR Inox's rent cost increased 15 percent to Rs 893.5 crore in the nine months of FY24 from Rs 775.2 crore in FY23. Its cost of common area maintenance (CAM) also increased 15 percent to Rs 246.4 crore from Rs 213.6 crore in FY23. Times are tough today for the theatre business with a weak content lineup and product innovations have become the need of the hour. But PVR Inox plans to continue offers on movie tickets and F\u0026B even when the content lineup is good. \"The coming months will not be easy because of the content pipeline. But this is also a phase when we learn to adapt. 2025 will be an eventful year for Bollywood and Hollywood. And we will continue with these products even when the content lineup is good. We are already looking at newer versions of these products like how I can make a family passport. Every time we launch something, we study for 6-8 months to understand how the consumer has accepted it,\" Dutta said.",

    "description": "Vijayakumar told PTI in an interview that HCL Technologies (HCLTech) is keen on acquisitions in areas of semiconductor, automotive, and of platforms that drive strong annuity revenues or geographies such as Japan.FY25 guidance of 3-5% good growth in current environment; cloud migration, GenAI gaining traction: HCLTech CEORelated stories",
    "content": "HCL Technologies' FY25 guidance of 3-5 per cent represents a \"good growth\" in current environment, CEO C Vijayakumar said, adding cloud migration and GenAI projects are gaining traction but financial services vertical could face 'headwinds'. Vijayakumar told PTI in an interview that HCL Technologies (HCLTech) is keen on acquisitions in areas of semiconductor, automotive, and of platforms that drive strong annuity revenues or geographies such as Japan. He asserted that the company is poised to capitalise on generative AI opportunities, and that 50,000 people are expected to be fully trained, leveraging GenAI, this year. The company reported nearly flat year-on-year net profit for March quarter at Rs 3,986 crore amid a global environment marred by weak client spends, geopolitical shocks, high inflation, and macroeconomic uncertainties. On a sequential basis the net profit was down 8.4 per cent. In the fourth quarter of FY24, the revenue from operations stood at Rs 28,499 crore, up 7.11 per cent from a year ago. For the full fiscal year (FY24), the company reported a 5.7 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 15,702 crore. The company posted Rs 1,09,913 crore in revenue in FY24, up 8.3 per cent from the previous fiscal. \"Across the industry there is good mix of revenue, which is coming from discretionary spending patterns of clients in this environment that is subdued, which will be visible in FY25. If things change sometime you will have a much better outcome, if things remain similar to what it was in FY24 then you will have subdued growth in FY25,\" Vijayakumar said. HCLTech's projected revenue growth of 3-5 per cent for FY25 is a \"good growth\" in current environment and probably highest guidance among the tier-one providers, according to Vijayakumar. Areas like cyber security, data, cloud migration to hyperscalers and building private AI stacks, all catalysed by GenAI are showing a good traction. Efficiency-driven programmes are being conduced in a timely-manner both in decision-making and timelines for execution. \"But some of the transformation programmes, I think customers are either taking a slightly slower pace or they're cutting down on some, pausing them for a few quarters or a few months, and then reinitiating it,\" he said. Technology, telecom and media verticals will continue to do well based on the bookings done, Vijayakumar said, but called out financial services as a space that could face some headwinds, after demonstrating a stellar growth for a couple of years. \"Financial services will have some headwinds now, because we've had a stellar growth for two years in financial services, significantly ahead of industry. So there will be some headwinds like some deals will transition to an offshore model. And then some deals like State Street...we have divested the JV...so that will have an impact on the revenue. So financial services will have these dynamics, but all other verticals will grow,\" he said. HCLTech added 2,700-plus employees in March quarter, which the top honcho said should not come as a surprise given the company's overall growth numbers. \"The headcount addition should not come as a surprise, because we had a good growth of 5.4 per cent (for FY24) in the current environment, so that obviously needs good talent to execute, and that's why our headcount is growing. And coming to FY25, of course, a lot will depend on how the year shapes up. At this point, we've planned at least 10,000 freshers to be hired during this year,\" he said. The lateral hiring numbers depend on how the year pans out. The US accounts for 64 per cent of the company's revenue and the company is very positive about outlook for the market. \"We've done very well. We've done 6.8 per cent growth in the US market and it continues to be a very strong geography, with good mindshare, presence in a lot of big clients. And so we are very positive about the outlook for US,\" he said. The company is well-equipped to capitalise on GenAI opportunities, and \"expects things to scale up\". \"In fact, we launched a platform called HCLTech AI Force. The platform helps end-to-end lifecycle of the software development and product engineering. So I think we're very well positioned,\" he said. He went on to add: \"We've got good talent, we have already trained a significant number of people, more than 25,000. This year, we expect at least 50,000 people will be fully trained, leveraging generative AI. We are focused on AI developer community, and already have 2,000-plus people who are focused in this area. And there are many small projects, which are all sub-USD 10 million,\" he said. On acquisitions, Vijayakumar said semiconductors, automotive, or platforms that drive strong annuity revenues with clients and geographies like Japan are areas where the company continues to look for buys. \"Yes, we have certain strategy on acquisitions in certain areas...Like we did a one in automotive a couple of quarters ago. We have some thinking in semiconductor, we have in some vertical capabilities, it will be small acquisitions...These are areas where we continue to look for acquisitions,\" he said.",

Tech tycoon’s family office bets on AI to prop $10 billion fundRelated stories",
    "content": "PremjiInvest, the largest Indian family office that manages over $10 billion for software tycoon Azim Premji, will invest more money into artificial intelligence companies while fine-tuning its proprietary AI investment tools, a senior executive at the firm said. The company, among the first large Indian asset managers to use AI tools in the private equity space, is now working on an AI quant model for its public market bets too, TK Kurien, its managing partner and chief investment officer, said in his first interview after taking the role in 2017. The asset manager, which has seen “exponential returns,” will also invest more in the AI space, he said. Investment firms worldwide, including BlackRock Inc. and SoftBank Group Corp, are relying on AI to analyze data streams in real-time to glean market intelligence and are looking to invest further in the sector. PremjiInvest started developing AI tools three years ago and hired 14 AI engineers, according to Kurien. At the same time, it started backing firms venturing into the nascent technology space. Cohesity Inc. — a data-management software company, Holistic AI — an enterprise software business based in London, Ikigai and Pixis are among firms in the sector that PremjiInvest had backed so far. Kurien is planning to allow open-source developers to access some of its AI tools. The fund’s engineers are also developing platforms to help India’s overburdened courts resolve cases faster and to also aid governments’ efforts to offer services more effectively, he said. Investment StrategyTechnology and financial services will be the top sectors in which PremjiInvest will be betting on, Kurien said. In private markets in India, the other two sectors in which the firm invests are consumer and health care. In the US, the investments are focused on health care and technology sectors. Premji, the reclusive-billionaire founder of Wipro Ltd., established the family office as a perpetual investment vehicle in 2006 to generate profits to support his philanthropic endeavors. He has donated most of his wealth to humanitarian causes in India. Kurien, who earlier worked with Wipro for more than 16 years building up his operational chops, is scouting for investment targets in the US with the latest technologies that can be brought to India. PremjiInvest’s 120-member team, working across its Menlo Park, California, and Bengaluru, India offices, oversees investments. The outfit returns about 5% of its capital to Premji’s philanthropic foundation every year, Kurien said, declining to provide further details. PremjiInvest’s assets are allocated as private investments, publicly traded equities and investments into other funds, according to Kurien. The 18-year-old firm has seen a fourfold surge in assets under management in the last eight years. “We are patient capital without an exit time frame,” he said.",

    "description": "The company is focusing on growth rather than margin gainsThanks to the stock’s underperformance following tepid result and outlook post Q3, the valuation is now beginning to turn reasonableRelated stories",
    "content": "Highlights  Challenging quarter due to project cancellations Source: Company The company saw two project cancellations in the BFSI (banking, financial service \u0026 insurance) vertical as the client reprioritised spending. The revenue for the quarter at $1069.4 million exhibited a sequential decline of 1.3 percent both in reported currency as well as constant Currency (CC). In terms of industry, besides BFSI, manufacturing showed a sequential decline in Q4 due to higher pass-through revenue in the preceding quarter. All the three geographies of North America, Europe, and the Rest of the World were soft during the quarter.  Source: Company For FY24, revenue at $4.3 billon showed a growth of 4.4 percent in reported currency and 4.2 percent in Constant Currency. Guiding to a better Q1 The nature of the deals has changed from discretionary to long-term efficiency, leading to a divergence in the order wins and revenue growth so far. However, LTIM has seen quite a few large deal ramp-ups and expect revenue to be back on the growth path from Q1. Overall, FY24 was marred by lower discretionary spend and a decline in growth among its top 40 customers. Source: Company For FY24, order bookings at $5.6 billion were up 15 percent. The company alluded to having a good pipeline of cost takeout deals. Project cancellation impacted margin, improvement target pushed out LTIM reported a sequential decline of 70 basis points in operating margin, thanks to the 80 basis points hit coming from project cancellation and another 60 basis points from higher sales \u0026 marketing expenses and depreciation. These were partially offset by a positive impact of 70 basis points from the reversal of furloughs. As revenue picks up, in the absence of one-off, margins should gradually improve. However, the company would like to invest in the business for growth and is, therefore, pushing back achieving the intended margin band of 17-18 percent by a few more quarters. The supply-side challenges are waning with attrition stabilising around 14.4 percent. While the company added freshers in the quarter, net headcount addition declined. Given the elevated utilisation of 85 percent, we expect LTIM to start building up a bench to capture future growth. Thanks to the stock’s underperformance following tepid result and outlook post Q3, the valuation is now beginning to turn reasonable. Despite the big miss in the current quarter, we see limited stock downside and recommend a gradual accumulation.

    "content": "Top multiplex chain PVR Inox has come up with another product to arrest the decline in footfalls in cinemas. They are offering ad-free movies just like a streaming platform. Weak box office collections of movies have affected the theatre business with big Bollywood films also delivering sub-par performance in the last three months. Cutting down the length of the ads slotted before a movie begins on the big screen from 35 minutes to 10 minutes, the company is looking to add extra shows. Audiences will not see commercials even during intervals. Just trailers of upcoming movies. \"The advertising revenue loss will be compensated with the additional footfalls by having one more show. Admissions generate ticket sales as well as F\u0026B sales,\" Palliere said. Also read: PVR Inox to open nearly half of new screens in South as it looks to improve its performance In Q3, the company reported a 23 percent year-on-year increase in advertising revenue at Rs 140.5 crore. But analysts expect the ad revenue to decline by 15 percent in the March quarter of FY24. However, there will be some brands visible during the reduced break time like Pepsi and Coke. \"In the 10 minutes of content shown before the start of the film, there will be largely movie trailers. This is to focus on our products for which consumers are coming to cinemas. But brands like Pepsi and Coke we are keeping on the screen within the 10 minutes,\" added Palliere. The new product by the company is not for everyone as it has been launched across seven luxury properties of the multiplex chain in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, among others, effective from April 1. \"In this segment (premium screen) people are time conscious. Also, a lot of these ads were countrywide and were not focused towards that particular audience,\" he added. The initial feedback for ad-movies is showing higher recall value, said Palliere. Ad-free content is available in PVR Inox's premium formats like Director's Cut and Insignia. Also read: Theatres stare at another weak quarter, PVR Inox likely to report loss in Q4 due to dull content \"We will soon be opening (ad free movies) in Pune and very soon it will follow in other premium screens. Within the next few months, we are looking at extending beyond the current batch,\" said Palliere, who is looking to increase the share of premium screens in the total screen portfolio of PVR Inox. Premium screens make up 15 percent of the total 1,741 screens across PVR Inox properties. Palliere expects the share to go up to 20 percent in less than 24 months. He added that the premium formats have not been as affected as regular screens due to weak content performance of films from the beginning of 2024. While the company has launched movies without commercial breaks after  getting feedback from customers, Palliere said that the expectation of increasing frequency of visits to theatres will help in improving footfalls which remains 25-30 percent lower versus pre-Covid levels across India's theatres. \"From a luxury point of view, we are not seeing as much impact of the tepid lineup as the rest of the screens because the experience goes beyond movie watching. Luxury in many ways has shown resilience in terms of occupancy which is not fully impacted by performance of movies. However, this (ad-free movies) will help improve admissions. Occupancy in premium format is in the high 20 percent to low 30 percent but it is not yet back to pre-Covid levels when it was in mid 30s to high 30s (percent). This is because of volatility in content and box office earnings,\" Palliere said.",

India's government last year rolled out incentives for green energy transition, with an aim to have 500 GW of installed capacity through non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. India's power consumption grew 8% in fiscal year 2023. The International Energy Agency estimates that India will add electricity demand roughly equivalent to the current consumption of the United Kingdom over the next three years. \"To meet the projected demand, market needs to generate at least 3-4 times than what is being done.

    "content": "Co-working firm WeWork Global, which has filed for bankruptcy in the US, is in talks with potential investors to sell its entire 27 per cent stake in WeWork India to monetise its investments, sources said. Bengaluru-based real estate firm Embassy Group, which holds the remaining 73 per cent stake in WeWork India, might also dilute some shareholdings to raise funds, they added. WeWork India, which started operations in 2017, has over 8 million square feet of assets signed across 54 locations in New Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Gurugram, Noida, Pune, and Hyderabad. In June 2021, WeWork Global invested USD 100 million in WeWork India to pick a 27 per cent stake. The investments helped Indian business to tide over the financial difficulties during the COVID pandemic, which had severely affected the office market. When contacted, WeWork India CEO Karan Virwani declined to comment. Sources said, WeWork India will continue to use the 'WeWork' brand even if WeWork Global sells its entire stake and exits from the India business. WeWork India will pay some fees to use the brand name. In November last year, WeWork Global filed for bankruptcy in the US and also started a comprehensive reorganization and restructuring process to cut debt and strengthen its balance sheet. NYSE-listed WeWork Inc had said that its centres located outside the US and Canada will not be part of this proceedings. Softbank-backed WeWork Inc, which was founded in 2010 and once valued at USD 47 billion, had reported a net loss of USD 696 million in the first half of 2023. WeWork India has been maintaining that the development in the US business would not impact Indian operations in any manner. \"WeWork India operates independently of WeWork Global, and our operations will not be affected in any manner,\" Virwani had said. \"During this period, we will continue to hold the rights to use the brand name as part of the operating agreement, while serving our members, landlords, and partners as usual,\" he had asserted.",

    "content": "ChatGPT developer OpenAI hired its first employee in India, appointing a government relations head just as the country votes in a new administration that will shape artificial intelligence regulations in the world’s most populous nation. The Microsoft Corp. backed-company recruited Pragya Misra to lead public policy affairs and partnerships in India, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named as the appointment isn’t yet public. Misra, 39, previously worked at Truecaller AB and Meta Platforms Inc. and is set to start at OpenAI toward the end of the month. The hiring highlights the generative-AI company’s efforts to push for favorable rules as governments around the world consider how to regulate the rapidly developing technology. India — with its 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing economy — is a massive growth opportunity for global tech companies, but it’s also proven a difficult one to navigate because of lawmakers and regulators seeking to ensure local firms don’t get trampled. Misra previously headed public affairs at Stockholm-traded contact verification firm Truecaller, which counts India as a top market. Before that, she was at Meta Platforms Inc., where she led WhatsApp’s campaign against misinformation in 2018. In India, OpenAI faces competition from the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which is developing an AI model specifically for the country. Its product will be able to handle more than 100 local languages across speech and text, a drive that would widen internet access beyond the country’s urban English-speaking minority. Countries such as India should support AI research in ways that can improve government services like health care, OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman said during his visit to India last year. “The main thing that I think is important is figuring out how to integrate these technologies into other services,” Altman said at the time. “That is an area that I think governments are behind on, and don’t have the answers yet.” Altman, who met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the tour, also said that India was an early adopter of its generative-AI service ChatGPT. Altman has previously called for more regulations and said his “greatest fear” is that the technology would cause significant harm. He has also said that big regulatory changes weren’t needed for current versions of the technology, but would be soon.",

    "content": "Bajaj Auto is aiming to achieve its target of producing 10,000 units of its Triumph motorcycles each month by September, a company executive said on Thursday. \"I would pin that in the first half (of fiscal 2025),\" Dinesh Thapar, Bajaj Auto's financial chief, said in a post-earnings call when asked about the goal's trajectory. \"Consider between now and September,\" he said. Thapar had earlier mentioned the company's 10,000 units-a-month goal in January, without specifying a timeline. It currently makes about 6,500 units a month. Since the launch, Bajaj has sold about 42,000 units to dealerships, the company said in a statement. Of those, 18,800 were sold in the March quarter. Triumph accounted for 2.1% of Bajaj Auto's total two-wheeler sales in the fourth quarter. Its overall two-wheeler sales rose about 26% in the quarter year-on-year. Bajaj Auto's Triumph is still overshadowed by market leader Royal Enfield, whose motorcycles are made by Eicher Motors in India. Both Bajaj's alliance and Hero MotoCorp's partnership with Harley Davidson are anticipated to pose a challenge to the Bullet bike-maker. Bajaj Auto's standalone net profit climbed 35.1%, to 19.36 billion rupees ($231.8 million) for the three months to March 31 from a year earlier, beating analysts' average estimate of 18.26 billion rupees, according to LSEG data. This was aided by strong, improved demand for entry-level models in rural India and steady sales of mid-level motorcycles in cities. A pick-up in exports to some overseas markets such as Latin America along with a low base also helped. Bajaj Auto is the first among its Indian two-wheeler maker peers to report its March-quarter results.",

    "content": "The mining investment arm of Abu Dhabi's most valuable company has offered to buy a majority stake in Vedanta Resources' Zambian copper assets, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, in its drive to build an African copper mining empire. The unit of International Holding Company recently made an offer of more than $1 billion to buy a 51% stake in Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) from Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta, the sources said. The unit - International Resources Holding (IRH) - is racing to broaden its burgeoning copper mining business in Zambia after buying a 51% stake in Mopani Copper Mines in a deal worth $1.1 billion. IRH said last month it planned to bid for a stake owned by EMR Capital in Lubambe Copper Mine, which is also for sale. The IRH offer for a controlling stake is non-binding and talks are ongoing, one of the sources said. Vedanta might balk at giving up a majority interest in KCM as it has always wanted the assets on its balance sheet, the source added. \"IRH is deeply committed to strategically expanding its presence in the copper mining sector, exemplified by our interest in multiple assets,\" IRH said in reply to a request for comment. It declined to comment on \"ongoing discussions\". Vedanta wants to sell part of its 80% stake in KCM and has hired Standard Chartered to manage the process in an effort to raise capital to revive the assets, which were nearly paralysed in an ownership dispute with the government that erupted in 2019 when the then-administration seized them. The Zambian government owns 20% of KCM through state firm ZCCM-IH. Stanchart issued a \"request for proposals\" seeking investors interested in buying a minority interest in KCM, the sources said. IRH is only interested in a controlling stake in KCM as there are no clear benefits in becoming a passive investor in the operations, the sources said, as they are not making money and need significant investment. Asked for comment, Vedanta said Stanchart was assisting in a \"broader strategy to manage its capital structure and ensure the company has the funds necessary to meet its obligations and continue operations again.\"\"As part of this process, we are engaging with prospective partners for both short-term financing and longer-term equity financing but cannot disclose the names of these partners or investors due to the sensitive stage these discussions have reached.\" TROUBLED LEGACYVedanta recently regained control of the assets after protracted legal battles, including international arbitration, with the previous Zambian government which seized the copper mines and smelting plant after accusing the company of failing to invest in expanding copper production.The legal squabbles, which erupted following the May 2019 government-forced liquidation of KCM, starved the operations of fresh capital and nearly brought them to a standstill. Now Vedanta wants to raise about $1 billion to invest in the assets over the next five years and an additional $300 million to pay off outstanding local creditors, Chris Griffith, the CEO of Vedanta's base metals unit told Reuters in February. Much of the funding is required to advance the Konkola Deep Mining Project, an underground operation, which holds one of the world's richest copper deposits. Vedanta is open to selling either a minority or majority stake and the company is seeing interest from various investors, a third source said. A rally in copper prices is likely to fuel investors' interest in the assets, but they may be unnerved by tough conditions including removing groundwater from the Konkola Deep underground operation, another source at a global miner which previously explored a deal over the assets, told Reuters.",

    "content": "Rating agency ICRA on Thursday said the volumes of domestic mining and the construction equipment (MCE) industry may drop in the current financial year on account of a slowdown in the new project orders amidst Lok Sabha elections and monsoon-related impact on construction activities. \"ICRA expects FY2025 to see a 12-15 per cent year-on-year decline (which translates into volumes of 1.14-1.18 lakh units),\" the rating agency said in a statement. This drop is following two consecutive years of strong growth of 26 per cent in FY'23 and 24 per cent in FY'24. \"Additionally, the aggregate revenues for ICRA's sample set companies are expected to contract by 9-12 per cent and operating margins by 100-150 basis points in FY2025,\" the statement said. The re-election push by the government on project execution led to a strong demand momentum for the domestic mining and construction industry in the last two years. However, with a likely disruption in project award activity for two consecutive quarters -- in the fourth quarter of FY'24 and first quarter of FY'25, amidst the Lok Sabha elections and monsoon-related impact on construction activities in the second quarter, the first half of FY'25 is likely to see a moderation in sales, Ritu Goswami, Sector Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA said.",

AI computing is on pace to consume more energy than India, Arm saysRelated stories",
    "content": "AI’s voracious need for computing power is threatening to overwhelm energy sources, requiring the industry to change its approach to the technology, according to Arm Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Rene Haas. By 2030, the world’s data centers are on course to use more electricity than India, the world’s most populous country, Haas said. Finding ways to head off that projected tripling of energy use is paramount if artificial intelligence is going to achieve its promise, he said. “We are still incredibly in the early days in terms of the capabilities,” Haas said in an interview. For AI systems to get better, they will need more training — a stage that involves bombarding the software with data — and that’s going to run up against the limits of energy capacity, he said. Arm, which began trading on the Nasdaq last year after 2023’s largest US initial public offering, sees AI and data center computing as one of its biggest growth drivers. Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. are using Arm’s technology as the basis of in-house chips that help run their server farms. As part of that shift, they’re decreasing reliance on off-the-shelf parts made by Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. By using more custom-built chips, companies can lessen bottlenecks and save energy, according to Haas. Such a strategy could reduce data center power by more than 15%. “There needs to be broad breakthroughs,” he said. “Any piece of efficiency matters.”",

    "content": "MG Motor India is driving towards tier III and IV cities of the country with plans to establish 100 new touchpoints by the end of the ongoing fiscal year as part of its strategy to fuel the next phase of growth, a senior company official said on Wednesday. With JSW Group coming in as an investor and becoming a joint venture partner with China's SAIC, last month the company announced plans to invest Rs 5,000 crore and had set a target of selling one million units of passenger electric vehicles in India by 2030 when the total market is expected to be 10 million units annually. The company is targeting 520 sales and service touchpoints overall in 270 cities by the end of 2024-25.

Bajwa further said to supplement these plans the company also has to improve its footprints in the Indian market to be closer to the consumers for the brand to gain their confidence and trust. \"So keeping that objective in mind, we are now looking at how we can improve our reach and depth in terms of our network as a first step,\" he said. Currently, Bajwa said, \"We have about 380 touchpoints, which cover about 170 odd cities. Now we are very clear that we have to go closer to 300 cities going forward as part of our expansion plan and these 380 touchpoints obviously, will go beyond 500 touchpoints in this financial year.\" Apart from existing dealers, the company will also onboard new partners for the network expansion, he said. In terms of geography, he said, \"While we are fairly well represented, in tier one, metro and super metro towns but beyond that in tier three or four towns, presence is missing.

    "description": "The Sugarbox employees revealed that they had received no formal communication from the company about the closure of operations and allege that there had been miscommunication over their employment contractsZee's tech subsidiary Sugarbox has shut down its operations. Related stories",
    "content": "Zee Entertainment’s tech subsidiary Margo Networks Pvt Ltd, which offers internet connectivity under the brand name Sugarbox, shut its operations on March 22, putting 50-60 of employees out of work. The closure came amid the entertainment and media company’s deepening financial problems. Zee Entertainment, which is currently grappling with the fallout of its terminated merger deal with Sony, is cutting its workforce and has laid off 50 percent of the staff at its Technology \u0026 Innovation Centre (TIC) in Bengaluru. While Zee reported a 140 percent increase in profit to Rs 58.5 crore in the December quarter of FY24, its profit dropped 52 percent sequentially, from Rs 122.96 crore in Q2 FY24. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Rohit Gupta said that net profit for the third quarter and year (FY24) was impacted by merger expenses and related exceptional items, which came to about Rs 60.3 crore during the quarter. Employees of Sugarbox were informed of the closure decision through a virtual call, with no written communication. It is unclear if the salaries that were pending for February and March will be paid. Moneycontrol has reached out to Zee and Sugarbox with detailed queries and will update this article once they respond. Some of the employees have been handed over letters saying that their resignation had been accepted and that their dues had been cleared. Moneycontrol has seen a screenshot of the letter. “This is to inform you that the resignation request has been accepted and mutually agreed to relieve (the employee) from the services of the company. This is in effect from the closing working hours of 22nd March 2024. There are no dues left and all exit formalities have been completed,” the letter said. “We were working with full force because they told us that they were getting a new contract for some tourist trains and we had to deploy our systems over there,” one employee told Moneycontrol. “Then on March 22, we received a message on Slack to join a virtual call. We had no idea what the call was about. Earlier in the day, Rohit (Paranjpe, co-founder of Sugarbox) told us that he has a meeting with Zee and he will come back with an update. Later, over a virtual call we were informed that they were shutting down the organisation.” Unpaid salaries For many months, Sugarbox assured its employees that it would receive funds from Zee, an assurance that led them to stick around despite the delay in receiving salaries. Zee, however, had been paring its investments in the tech subsidiary. “On March 15, Rohit said that there would be a few more days of delay (in paying salaries) and that he was sorry for the delay. On March 14, he said that the Zee team was working towards getting funds transferred…. and that it would be the last delay,” the employee cited above said. A March 19 message by Paranjpe on Slack read, “Guys, just an update on salary/funding. Things have been running delayed from Zee’s end. I will keep everyone posted as soon as there is an update from Zee, but they are working to get the approvals this week (and get the funds to us within 2-3 days once that is done).” Speaking to Moneycontrol, another employee of Sugarbox said, “Salary delays happened in the past. I had joined in March 2023, and my first salary got disbursed in June. This was the first delay I faced—right after joining the company. But I continued and tried to complete one year as I had trust in the company’s idea.” Another employee Moneycontrol spoke to said that Paranjpe had been assuring them that if Zee didn’t fund the company, there were other investors. In one Slack message on January 22 this year, Paranjpe told employees that the termination of the merger between Zee and Sony would have no impact on Sugarbox. The $10 billion merger deal had been terminated that day. “We have already agreed with the Zee board to demerge and raise money from a set of fresh investors and we’re working with the Zee team to get this done,” the message elaborated. Days of promise In 2017, Zee had bought an 80 percent stake in Margo Networks. In April 2020, it invested Rs 522 crore in the tech startup. Margo offers internet services in areas with poor or no network, allowing users to access its servers over a local wi-fi network at key places of interest (PoI), including public places, public transport, hotels and malls. The company partnered with Hyderabad and Chennai Metro rail to provide free entertainment and WiFi in metro trains. Zee5’s statistics for the Hyderabad Metro in February 2020 showed a 3x increase in data consumption from October 2019, according to a 2020 Sugarbox Business Summary deck on the Zee website. The presentation also mentioned the various tenders awarded to Sugarbox, including one to install its technology across 472 buses and bus 11 terminals in Navi Mumbai. It also mentioned a tender awarded by the Common Services Centre for installation of its tech in 100 Grampanchayats, of which installation in 50 Gram Panchayat was completed. The tide turns However, during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call for FY21 (January to March 2021), Zee CEO and MD Punit Goenka had said that due to prioritising content investments in digital and television, and because of the prolonged uncertainty due to the Covid pandemic, the company was re-evaluating its investment in Sugarbox and would scale it down. Zee reiterated this in March 2024, when it announced it was institutionalising a ‘Monthly Management Mentorship Program’ under which a special committee would review the management’s business performance. The committee’s first review identified key business verticals that require critical assessment, including tech subsidiary Margo Networks. Not the first time Sugarbox laid off a majority of its employees in September 2023. Out of the total strength of 220-250 people, around 60-70 remained with the company. On April 5, Paranjpe, in a WhatsApp message to employees, said that their employment contracts were terminated on September 30 last year, and this was applicable to everyone, including him. “However, we continued to work till 22/03/24 (March 22, 2024) without an active contract– applies to everyone including me,” the message read. He went on to say that he was sorry to have believed in the investor that had supported them for over seven years. One of the employees questioned Paranjpe on how salaries were being paid if the employees had been terminated last year, to which the co-founder responded saying it was mercy pay. “I asked him if all the employees were terminated in September 2023, then how come the remaining staff got increments? I got a 20 percent hike. I had an offer from some other company but they retained me and offered me the hike in October 2023. However, many employees did not get an appraisal for around two years. Only those who had offers from other firms were retained,” said another Sugarbox employee. The tech company continued hiring until this year despite the lack of funds. An employee who was hired in January has two months’ salary pending. The Zee-Sony merger deal would have brought investments worth $1.5 billion from Sony in the combined entity had it gone through. Zee is now looking to reduce its losses. Analysts note that the company has less than Rs 500 crore in cash equivalents to fund its growth and ward off competitive pressures.",

It expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets within 6-9 months of the issue. Analysts believe that the Rs 18,000 crore fundraising will improve Vodafone Idea’s competitiveness with rival telecom operators to some extent and lead to a sharp reduction in bank debt, allowing it to secure further funding from banks. However, they cautioned they don’t expect Vodafone Idea to gain any meaningful market share from its peers.",

    "content": "Max Healthcare Institute Ltd will invest over Rs 5,000 crore to more than double its bed capacity to over 8,000 beds in the next four to five years with half of the investment to be made in Uttar Pradesh, according to its Chairman and MD Abhay Soi. The company, which had last year acquired Sahara Hospital in Lucknow for an enterprise value of Rs 940 crore has renamed it as Max Super Specialty Hospital, Lucknow. It plans to invest Rs 2,500 crore in Uttar Pradesh (UP) which includes setting up of a new 500 beds hospital on 5.6-acre parcel of land located at Shaheed Path and augmentation of capacity of the acquired facility. \"UP is a state which is marching towards becoming a USD 1 trillion economy by 2027. There is a tremendous amount of development which is happening. \"For the development of any economy it is a prerequisite that healthcare also develops over there... We wanted to participate in the development of the state,\" Soi told PTI. He further said, \"Given the development which is happening (in the state) and the increase in per capita income, it calls for much larger investment in healthcare.\" On the immediate expansion in UP, he said at Max Super Specialty Hospital, Lucknow, which is a 550-bed hospital, the company is \"looking at expanding by another 300-odd beds going forward\". \"Other than this we have acquired land for a greenfield hospital at Shaheed Path for another 500 beds. Between these, we will have over 2,000 beds in the next few years... This would be at an investment of Rs 2,500 crore and we will be employing more than 10,000 people.\" With this, Max Healthcare will be the largest private healthcare network in UP, he asserted. When asked if Max Healthcare Institute will be focussing only on UP for its expansion in the near future, he replied in the negative. \"We would look at other states too for expansion... We will be in multiple places as well,\" Soi said, citing examples of how the company has expanded in Nagpur and Pune, and is also looking at other parts of the country. On investments on overall expansion across India, he said it will be over Rs 5,000 crore in the next four to five years to more than double the bed capacity to over 8,000 beds. At present, the company has 4,000 operational beds and is looking to add another 4,200 beds in the next four to five years. When asked if the company would go for acquisitions only or set up new facilities for the planned expansions, Soi said, \"It will be both. Where we can do acquisitions we would like to do acquisitions... we have seen in Lucknow itself, we have done one acquisition and the other is a greenfield. If we get another, we'd be happy to do it.\" On the funding of the expansion in UP, he said it will be through internal accruals. \"We are a debt-free company and we generate enough internal accruals to fund it,\" Soi said. Max Healthcare said it will introduce state-of-the-art cancer care and robotic surgical systems besides strengthening the organ transplantation program at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Lucknow. It will bring in high-end tertiary and quaternary care to patients in Lucknow and neighbouring areas and the hospital will serve as an important referral centre for patients from Eastern and Central Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. \"With direct flight connectivity to several countries, the company will also explore attracting medical value travel patients from neighbouring countries and the Middle East to Max Super Speciality Hospital, Lucknow,\" the company added.",

    "content": "Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. expects the addition of the country’s sovereign bonds to JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co.’s global indexes from June to boost banks’ liquidity and reduce the need to aggressively pursue deposits in the short term. The anticipated entry of overseas funds into India’s $1.2 trillion government debt market presents an opportunity for lenders including Kotak to sell part of their bond investments to these new buyers, according to Joint Managing Director K.V.S Manian. The move is expected to unlock funds for lending purposes and ease the pressure on banks that have been relying on costly deposits to disburse loans, Manian said in an interview. Kotak holds securities well in excess of the minimum statutory liquidity ratio mandated by the Reserve Bank of India, he said. Banks in India are the largest holders of government bonds. Kotak’s daily average liquidity coverage ratio for the December quarter was 126.85%, higher than the regulatory threshold of 100%, according to its latest financial disclosures.  Indian lenders continue to face challenges in attracting lower-cost deposits, as customers are putting their savings in India’s booming stock market and higher-yielding term deposits instead. With the loan-to-deposit ratio sitting at its peak, there are concerns about the impact on credit growth in the country where deposits typically fund around 70% to 80% of bank assets, Rahul Jain, co-head of Asia Pacific Financials Research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said earlier this month.

    "content": "Nepalese billionaire Binod Chaudhary, who made his fortune selling instant noodles, is seeking to list his conglomerate Chaudhary Group’s India food unit by 2026. The Gurgaon-based firm, known for its Wai Wai brand of noodles that rivals market leader Maggi from Nestle Ltd. and ITC Ltd.’s Yippee, “would be ready to go for a sizable listing” in the next two years after rolling out new products and acquiring smaller firms in the noodle-related industry, Manvendra Shukla, global chief executive officer at CG Foods India Pvt., said in an interview. He didn’t share any other details. The listing plans for the firm, which has a 28% share in the local instant noodles market and an annual revenue of 8 billion rupees ($96.2 million), are still in the early stages of discussion, he added. It aims to grow its revenue by 15% this year. Read More: Rich Valuations Power Indian IPOs to Record Start: ECM Watch The noodle maker, however, is not rushing to list and plans to bolster its market share and product portfolio first. The company is also looking to buy smaller companies that make seasonings, dips or ketchups, Shukla said. ‘Not Replicated’Chaudhary Group launched the Wai Wai noodle four decades ago in Nepal’s capital Kathmandu, and has since grown to become India’s third largest brand. Wai Wai is known for its pre-seasoned noodle — it comes with a layer of spice in addition to the seasoning pouches in the packet — which means it can also be munched on as a snack without cooking it. “We have something which is not replicated yet in the market,” Shukla said. CG Foods India currently has seven plants across the country, with Nepal and India contributing over 80% to the group’s food sales. The firm expects to add production lines as volumes continue to grow in India where sales of snacks and soft drinks almost tripled over the past decade in India, exceeding $30 billion. It launched two flavors last month, including a spicier variant called Dynamite, inspired by the Korean cuisine. More products are in the pipeline, including healthier noodle options, according to Shukla. “It is a flavor battle,” he said.",

A new property launched by PVR Inox in Bengaluru. Related stories",
    "content": "India's top multiplex operator PVR Inox is adding more screens down South as it looks to improve its operational performance at a time when the cinema business is struggling due to a lack of content and lower occupancies. \"The South market is 33 percent of our portfolio which is 588 screens out of 1,741 screens. 40 percent of the screens which are opening now (in FY25) are going to be in the South. We have to go where the consumption is high and we only want to deploy capital in those catchments where we get the highest returns. In the south average occupancy is high,\" Ajay Bijli, Managing Director, PVR INOX Limited, told Moneycontrol. Best performing market \"Bengaluru is one of the best-performing cities for PVR Inox because of the number of languages that get consumed over here. All sorts of movies get consumed here which is the reason why this is our 26th property in Bengaluru. The company's share is 33 percent in the city where the movie-going culture is strong. Going forward, we are keen to open cinemas in those cities where the movie-going consumption is high.\" While PVR is increasing its focus on the South market, it is cutting down capital expenditure and is closing down some of its screens. It plans to reduce its capital expenditure by 30-40 percent in FY25 over the previous year to Rs 400-450 crore. Asset light model \"We are going with the FOCO model which is a franchise-owned company operated model. A lot of retail companies that we are benchmarking against have moved to the FOCO model. We want to go with an asset-light model and we have already deployed a lot of capital. We also want to be careful where we open screens. The South is one focus. Rest of the territories we will be moving towards the FOCO model where we would want the developer to spend money if they want the brand and we will be spending close to 20 percent of the capital,\" Bijli said. In FY25, the company plans to open 100 screens more and may also disinvest in 90 screens. \"We are also closing some of our cinemas around 125 screens in FY25 which have reached the end of lease and also they have become obsolete compared to new malls which are coming up. So, whatever is disruptive we are closing,\" the MD said. Due to quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) volatility in gross box office performance which has increased post-pandemic, deleveraging has become a top priority, the company said. It is looking at liquidating its real estate assets in prime locations of Mumbai, Pune, and Vadodra. \"We have a large land bank of Rs 300-400 crore which we want to sell this year and try to pare down our debt,\" Bijli said. Leaner organisation In the next 12-18 months, PVR Inox said it will shut down non-performing screens, renegotiate rental contracts with landlords, reduce capex intensity, and become free cash flow positive to improve operational performance. \"A much leaner organisational structure has been announced from April 1. With the merger, you need to be aware of the costs because you have a much larger entity. After the merger is done one has to look at ROI (return on investment), ROCE (return on capital employed), and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation). We felt that both the brands are established so there is an urgency to grow everywhere. The focus is going to be on profitability and to pare down the debt.\" In the nine months of FY24, PVR Inox's gross debt stood at Rs 1,608.1 crore. The company had reduced its gross debt by Rs 184.6 crore over nine months of FY24. The company's proportion of minimum guarantee rental contracts has gone down giving way to revenue-sharing rental agreements. The idea is to reduce the rental cost to pre-Covid levels which was 16-17 percent of revenue from the current 19-20 percent of revenue level. BIjli said that chief executive officer (CEO) Gautam Dutta is looking at revenue and F\u0026B (food and beverage) and his focus will be to get more people in cinemas, increase sales and advertising revenue). The company expects occupancy to increase to 29-30 percent in FY25 from the current level of 25 percent. The company expects advertising revenue to reach pre-Covid level on an absolute basis by FY25 but on a per-screen basis it will take more time. PVR Inox is also piloting a feature in collaboration with food delivery platform Zomato in Gurugram, wherein a customer can order from the multiplex chain's food menu on Zomato to get an in-cinema delivery. This is aimed to allow users to skip long queues formed at food kiosks during breaks.",

The official also said the government is considering changing highway construction measurement method to 'lane km' from 'road km' in the current financial year as the government's focus has now shifted to building more expressways that are of at least four lanes. Currently, the linear length method is used for measuring the progress of construction and widening of national highways, he added.",

According to the latest operational update, the company's net debt stood at Rs 1,160 crore at the end of 2023-24 fiscal, as compared to Rs 1,090 crore in FY23. \"The increase in net debt is due to significant addition to our land portfolio during the current financial year,\" Gurugram-based Signature Global said. In March, the company sold 1,008 luxury homes for around Rs 3,600 crore in its new project at Gurugram, Haryana, helping the company achieve record sales bookings during the last fiscal and beating the target of Rs 4,500 crore for 2023-24.

    "content": "Japanese tyre major Bridgestone expects to clock 25 per cent growth in revenue between 2024 and 2026 in India, which is its fastest-growing market globally, according to senior company officials. The company, which on Wednesday launched its 'Turanza 6i' premium range of passenger vehicle tyres developed specifically for the Indian market, will be increasing its tyre production to 40,000 per day in the next four to five years from the current 30,000 per day. \"The size of the business (in India) out of our total global portfolio today is limited. However, it is the fastest-growing business portfolio in our global business. So that's why huge attention is there and strategic attention is here in India,\" Bridgestone India Managing Director Hiroshi Yoshizane told PTI in an interview. When asked about the growth outlook in India, Bridgestone India Chief Commercial Officer Rajarshi Moitra said,\"Last year (2023) our revenue growth was 9 per cent and over a period between 2024 to 2026 we expect to grow our revenue by 25 per cent overall.\" Bridgestone India does not publicly share its revenue numbers. Moitra said this year the market has declined in the January-March quarter. \"But our estimation is that the market will grow back to the tune of 4.5-5 per cent in the second half of the year. Against this expected growth, if we (Bridgestone) have to gain market share we're looking at a 6-plus percentage growth as an aspiration for the balance of the year,\" he added. On the company's investments and capacity enhancement plans, Yoshizane said as part of the USD 300 million long term investments \"for manufacturing expansion and capability enhancement\" announced for India in 2017, Bridgstone had last year said it would invest Rs 600 crore on capacity expansion. \"At that time (2017) our domestic production capacity was around 15,000 per day. Now as of today, it has become 30,000 per day. So it's already doubled. Then it will go up 40,000 per day within the next four to five years,\" he said. Asked about the company's plans to tap the growing electric vehicle PV segment in India, Yoshizane said Bridgestone's new 'Turanza 6i' is an EV-ready premium product range, although not necessarily specific for electric passenger vehicles only. The product has been developed keeping in mind the Indian conditions. \"An EV when compared to the conventional one is heavier and has motor tractions and is more silent. So the tyre equipped with an EV should help in delivering a longer mileage, battery efficiency, durability to sustain the vehicle and silence. We are covering those key points with our product Turanza 6i,\" he said. On supplies to EV manufacturers in India, Moitra said,\"Currently we are working with the already present players such as Mahindra, Tata, Suzuki in terms of their projects. We have a set of EV developments lined up. As Tesla comes into India, we will reach out. We work with them in the US.\" However, Bridgestone will not supply for the import models of Tesla, he added. When asked about partnership with Vietnamese EV maker VinFast, Yoshizane said, \"Discussion is going on but no specific plans have been made as yet. Our OE sales team is working globally and monitoring OE movements on a global basis.\" Commenting on the company's retail network expansion, Moitra said,\"Today we service the market through 3,500 retail points on the consumer side, which is our car tyre business. This year, we expect to take it up to around 4,000 retail points.\"",

    "content": "Trouble for Air India Ltd. is mounting with aircraft technicians planning a strike later this month after its pilots voiced concerns last week about being overworked and underpaid. Technicians at AI Engineering Services Ltd. — a state-run maintenance, repair and overhaul firm and an erstwhile Air India unit — will strike on April 23 due to various issues affecting their “well-being” and “professional growth,” All India Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Union wrote in a letter dated April 8 to the chief executive officer. The unrest among aviation workers risks thwarting India’s air travel boom. Pilots and aircraft engineers are crucial to support the country’s rapid fleet expansion after IndiGo, Air India and Akasa placed orders for more than 1,100 aircraft combined. AI Engineering’s biggest client is Air India. Its staff are upset over lack of career advancement opportunities because they haven’t been promoted in the past seven years, according to the letter. The management promised a revised pay structure for technicians who have worked for at least two years with the firm but hasn’t followed through. The contractual employees, who form 75% of the company’s workforce, feel discriminated because they have to serve longer notice periods and aren’t given as many benefits as the permanent staff, the letter said. A representative for AI Engineering said the management has initiated discussions with the union to resolve the issue. AI Engineering has revised salaries of all staff except technicians as a court case is pending, it said. The company is planning to revise the pay of technicians after the union withdraws a court case, wherein it requested equal pay for contractual employees and permanent ones. Meanwhile, Air India pilots have echoed Vistara staff’s concerns, saying the issues of being underpaid and overworked are “systemic” across Tata’s aviation empire. Aircraft technicians have urged the management to resolve issues to avoid potential disruptions from the strike, the letter said.",

During the edtech's growth stage, several brick-and-mortar test preparatory firms entered the online space, while online education firms added brick-and-mortar centres. Mehrotra said digital alone is not enough to address the requirement of students preparing for high stake examinations. \"If a learner that you are talking to is preparing to pick up premier Indian institution, be it medical or engineering, it needs long learning. I am completely convinced it cannot be done digitally alone,\" he said. He, however, said that the digital medium is required to address the need of new learners who are more of digital natives. Mehrotra said that his company will look at reaching out to digital natives in the language of their choice by increasing the component of digital in the system at AESL.

    "content": "HSBC Holdings Plc is engaging with over 200 overseas funds to help establish their presence in India ahead of the nation’s entry into global debt indexes. The bank is among custodians helping global investors with registration and other formalities as they gear up for the nation’s sovereign debt to be added to JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co.’s emerging-market gauge from June. “Getting the bond index inclusion is starting of the journey,” Anita Mishra, head of markets and securities services for HSBC India, said in an interview last week. The bank is holding road shows, meeting funds in London, Hong Kong and the US, to “get the India story out there”.  As passive money starts to flow in most investors will need help with “onboarding onshore”, making it a “single biggest focus” for the bank, Mishra said. Foreigners have poured in nearly $10 billion into the nation’s index-eligible bonds since the JPMorgan’s announcement in September. The purchases have helped make the securities the best performers in local currency emerging Asia debt so far in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Market AccessibilityInvestors have cited several obstacles to obtaining an onshore permit in India, including heavy documentation process, margin requirements for trading, barriers to freely move money out of the country. FTSE Russell recently held off from adding India to its emerging market index, but acknowledged progress in “the accessibility” of the market. The regulator has introduced a common application form for foreign investors and allowed use of digital signatures among others.

    "description": "The Bengaluru-based firm has scored an early win among its peers with the UK approval for the first generic version of liraglutide injectible, which is losing patent protection in November. Biocon leads India push into weight loss drugs as patents lapseRelated stories",
    "content": "Biocon Ltd. is pivoting to anti-obesity therapies as patents for the blockbuster medications start to expire, unleashing a wave of generic supply for the market that’s expected to touch $100 billion by 2030. The Bengaluru-based firm has scored an early win among its peers with the UK approval for the first generic version of liraglutide injectible, which is losing patent protection in November. The weight loss drug, sold under the brand name Saxenda by patent holder Novo Nordisk A/S, is among the first of the groundbreaking medications in this category to lose patent protection. While Saxenda is far less effective for weight loss than later iterations like Wegovy and Ozempic, its generic version is just the beginning of a jackpot that drugmakers like Biocon are awaiting. “My leadership team and organization is ensuring that we do not give up the lead position we have now,” Chief Executive Officer Siddharth Mittal said in an interview. The company, helmed by Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, is leading the charge among Indian drugmakers — the world’s largest supplier of generic medicines — as they race to grab a slice of the obesity drugs market. The global frenzy around these medicines has already lured sector giants Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd., and Cipla Ltd., who are also developing their anti-obesity drugs. Weight loss drugs have already produced record profit for innovative pharmaceutical companies from Novo Nordisk to Eli Lilly \u0026 Co. The gold rush is set to spread to generic makers like India’s biggest players when patents expire in the coming years on Ozempic and Wegovy, allowing cheaper copies of the medication to flood the market and plug supply gaps. Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy are made with the same active ingredient, semaglutide, while Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide drug is sold as Zepbound. These, along with liraglutide, are part of a class of medications called glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1, agonists.  Biocon is building capability “to take advantage of what could be a very, very strategic peptide opportunity with GLPs at the center,” Group Chief Executive Officer Peter Bains told analysts in November. ‘Very Complementary’The loss of exclusivity for GLPs will create a multibillion dollar market over the next 10 years and this opportunity was “very complementary” to Biocon’s current biologics business, according to Bains. In the UK, Mittal said the company will wait for the publicly-funded, National Health Services, to float a tender to launch its liraglutide injectible. Biocon’s UK application was filed through its European partner, Zentiva SA. The total addressable UK market opportunity for GLP-1 in diabetes and weight loss is $425 million, according to a March 27 statement by Biocon. Despite the weight-loss segment being a rage globally, these drugs are yet to make an widescale appearance in India whose 1.4 billion-plus population is rapidly getting more affluent and obese. Read More: Junk Food Giants Find $30 Billion Prize in Under-Regulated India Novo Nordisk, which only sells its semaglutide-based pill Rybelsus in India, is planning to introduce injectibles Wegovy and Ozempic in 2026, Reuters reported in February. Eli Lilly is conducting clinical trials in India for weight-loss pill, orforglipron. Biocon has not yet filed for liraglutide approval in India and it is working with the local drug regulators to see if the requirement of a clinical trials can be waived, Mittal said. The company is also looking for a partner to market its obesity drugs in India after it sold its branded formulations business to Eris Lifesciences Ltd. last month. Over the next 20 years, “this is a very attractive space”, Mittal said. The UK approval shows that Biocon can confidently “capture the opportunity in the coming years.”",

    "title": "Very confident Srinivas Pallia will turn around Wipro: Former CFO Suresh Senapaty",
    "description": "Senapaty's ringing endorsement of Pallia comes months after he expressed concerns about losing great talent during Thierry Delaporte's tenure Wipro named Srinivas Pallia as the IT major's next CEORelated stories",
    "content": "Suresh Senapaty, former board member of Wipro and one of founder Azim Premji’s most trusted advisors, welcomed Srinivas Pallia's appointment as CEO, and believes he will turn around the fortunes of the software services firm. His statement comes on the back of an announcement by Wipro on April 6th, Saturday, where it said Pallia would take over from Thierry Delaporte, who is leaving a year ahead of his term, which was supposed to end in mid-2025. \"Srini is an extremely bright leader with very high potential.  I am very confident that he will turn around Wipro within reasonable time because he commands very high respect of the Wipro team and is very strong in strategy including execution excellence. All the best to Srini , Rishad (Premji) and the entire leadership team”, he said in a statement to Moneycontrol. “According to me, Wipro must regain its intolerance toward losing great talent by working more deeper in understanding of its talent repository. That’s critical for regaining its success trajectory of growth which has been subdued compared to industry for quite some time now”, he had said to Moneycontrol then. These comments were significant as it was the first time that a top leader of Wipro spoke out about the company’s senior management attrition and slowing growth, especially in the last few years, since Thierry Delaporte took charge as CEO in mid-2020. It’s also important because Senapaty is one of Wipro’s most senior leaders, having been associated with the firm since 1980 and is a key lieutenant of its promoter Azim Premji. He is still associated with Wipro at multiple levels. He’s been on the board of Wipro Enterprises since 2013, and Wipro GE Healthcare since 1995 and plays an advisory role in Premji Invest, the investment arm. He became the CFO of Wipro Corporation, heading the Finance function across IT, Consumer Care, Infrastructure Engineering, and Healthcare. He was a Member of the Board and CFO of Wipro Limited till his retirement in March 2015. Wipro’s revenue growth in constant currency on a year-on-year basis has fallen steeply since Q4FY22. Even in the previous quarter, the company had reported a fall in profit for the fourth consecutive quarter, falling 12 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 2,694 crore. It also adjusted its revenue growth guidance at both the lower and upper end. It revised its revenue growth guidance to -1.5 percent to 0.5 percent. This came after the company slashed the guidance to -3.5 percent to -1.5 percent in the previous quarter. Margins too have been a pain point for Wipro, which are among the lowest when compared to its peers. It has also seen a massive churn at the top level over the last two years. In 2023 alone, over 10 senior leadership members had quit the company including chief growth officer Stephanie Trautman, chief financial officer Jatin Dalal, chief operations officer Sanjeev Singh, India head Satya Easwaran, iDEAS business head Rajan Kohli, among many others. Industry experts gave a thumbs up to Wipro’s appointment of company veteran Srinivas Pallia as the new CEO instead of hiring an external candidate for the job, as the IT services major struggled to turnaround its business growth over the previous quarters. Prior to this new role, Pallia was the CEO for Wipro’s Americas I business. Analysts unanimously called this a well-thought out move as hiring an external CEO could potentially mean a few months of transition and structural changes. Between Wipro’s last two CEOs, Delaporte and Abidali Neemuchwala, many of the company’s senior leadership members and veterans exited the IT major.",

    "content": "Salary hike in senior level job roles is expected to reach an average of 20 per cent this year, as nurturing talent and fostering innovation remains a key focus area for companies amid the country's buoyant economic conditions, says a report. According to the Michael Page India Salary Guide 2024, there is a resurgence in hiring within traditional industries, particularly evident in the continued high demand for manufacturing and operations roles. Additionally, there's a notable surge in the need for professionals skilled in data analytics, generative AI, and machine learning across various sectors. According to the report, India's 6 per cent GDP growth coupled with significant domestic investments and independence from external factors, positions India uniquely in the region, even amidst global challenges. \"With India's economy displaying such resilience and optimism, and surpassing its pre-COVID performance, the focus is now on harnessing this potential. Nurturing talent and fostering innovation thus remains a key,\" said Ankit Agarwala, Managing Director at PageGroup. Agarwala further noted that the IT services industry, a cornerstone of the Indian economy, is witnessing a phase of recalibration. Companies are moderating their approach to salary increments, with expected hikes around 8 per cent-10 per cent. \"Industries like consumer, renewables, finance, and healthcare are flourishing, bolstered by investments from local and domestic companies,\" Agarwala said. Sector-wise analysis showed that in IT \u0026 Technology, the hike range varies from 35-45 per cent for junior employees, 30-40 per cent hike for mid-level executives, and 20-30 per cent increment for senior management. The property and construction sector is offering 20-40 per cent hike to juniors, 25-45 per cent hike to middle-level executives and a 20-40 per cent salary appraisal to seniors. \"As we delve deeper into 2024, the employment narrative in India is about more than just salaries. Flexibility, work culture, and professional growth opportunities are increasingly pivotal in job transitions, reflecting a maturing and holistic employment ecosystem,\" said Anshul Lodha, Managing Director at Page Group.

    "content": "The asset management unit at PAG-backed Nuvama Group of India plans to tap the wealthy in the Middle East for the first time. The Mumbai-based firm is targeting 40 billion rupees ($479 million) for its latest Nuvama Crossover IV fund and expects to raise at least $300 million from family offices and rich individuals in the Middle East, according to Anshu Kapoor, president and head of the business. The funds have a term of six years and invest in companies preparing to go public on Indian stock exchanges, he said. Indian money managers are looking to raise capital from international markets like the Mideast, the US and the UK, which have a large Indian diaspora keen to participate in the country’s rising wealth and buoyant stock markets. Firms are particularly drawn to the United Arab Emirates, expected to be the largest beneficiary of private wealth assets as Russian capital seeks new homes amid the war in Ukraine. Nuvama also expects to raise another $100 million from the region for a new public equities long-short product, he said. Both funds have been registered in India’s new financial hub of Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, known as GIFT City. To help raise capital for both funds, Nuvama enlisted Dubai-based placement agent Greenstone Equity Partners. The firm also plans to tap into the distribution networks of banks in the region, he said. After it finishes fundraising in the Middle East, Nuvama will offer the crossover fund to investors in India. In addition, the firm will begin marketing its $360 million commercial real estate fund, a joint venture with Cushman \u0026 Wakefield Plc, to domestic investors with the intention of taking it offshore later, Kapoor said. Strategic MovesThe Middle East and regions like Singapore and Hong Kong have large Indian populations as well as people with an “affinity to India,” with portfolio allocations of about 5% to 6% to the country, Kapoor said. He expects that to rise to about 10% to 12% in the next few years. Nuvama launched its asset management business in 2021 after its split with shadow lender Edelweiss Financial Services. Kapoor expects the firm’s assets under management to grow to 200 billion rupees in the next 12 to 18 months, up from 70 billion rupees. Nuvama also plans to add another 10 to 15 people across various strategies to its team of 75 over the next few months. Besides asset management, the group’s businesses consist of wealth management and capital markets. Nuvama Wealth Management Ltd. is also a portfolio company of PAG, the Asia-focused alternative asset manager that runs more than $55 billion in assets, according to its website. Nuvama Wealth has soared 36% this year, after listing in September.",

    "content": "Toyota Kirloskar Motor is looking to drive in more premium models in the country with customers gradually moving towards bigger-sized vehicles in the market, according to a senior company executive. The company, which sells models like Innova and Fortuner, on Wednesday expanded its range in the country with the introduction of entry-level SUV Urban Cruiser Taisor. In an interaction with PTI, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Deputy Managing Director Tadashi Asazuma (Sales and Marketing) said the company aims to cater to the diverse customer requirements in the market. Asazuma said customers are shifting from small cars to bigger cars gradually and that is one reason the company is even expanding its production capacity with a new manufacturing plant to offer new models. When asked if the company would look at bringing in more premium cars in the market, he noted, \"We think it should be necessary\". He further said: \"Last year, we announced (plans) to build a new plant in Bidadi. That is a preparation for meeting with the customer demand.\" The new plant is expected to commence production in 2026, Asazuma noted. The share of sports utility vehicles has risen to 50 per cent of overall wholesales in FY24 while the share of entry-level and sedans has reduced in the same period. On being asked if the company would focus on hybrid technology or battery electric vehicles in the market, he stated that the company has all kinds of technologies and the strategy is to \"meet customer requirements\". He said, \"As of now, in the case of India, we believe that strong hybrid vehicles are a practical solution. But of course, with more and more customer requirements coming in we will think about it (BEVs).\" On the timeframe for introducing its first BEV in the country, he declined to share details. Asazuma said the Indian market is very important for Toyota globally and that the automaker aims to grow along with the auto market which has now become the third largest globally. On the introduction of Urban Cruiser Taisor, Asazuma said the model would help the company to bring in more customers to its fold. The Urban Cruiser Taisor is TKM's version of Maruti Suzuki's Fronx. The automaker, a joint venture between Toyota Motor Company and Kirloskar Group, has also introduced a new scheme for online sales. \"We are now piloting it in Bangalore. If it is successful, it can be introduced at other locations as well. We do not have a detailed plan yet,\" Asazuma said. TKM currently has around 647 touchpoints across the country. Urban Cruiser Taisor is priced between Rs 7.73 lakh and Rs 13.03 lakh (ex-showroom). TKM Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Masakazu Yoshimura said the Indian market has always been of paramount importance to the company both in terms of product offerings and the introduction of advanced technologies. \"This emphasis was further underpinned by the recent creation of a new region where the Indian market plays an even more crucial role,\" he added. Looking ahead, the company's business strategy in the market will be to continue to focus on contributing to national priorities of localisation, developing a highly skilled workforce and achieving carbon goals, Yoshimura said.",

AGEL's 10,934 MW operational portfolio will power more than 5.8 million homes and avoid about 21 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, the statement said. \"We are proud to be India's first das hazari in the renewables space,\" said Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group. \"In less than a decade, Adani Green Energy has not just envisioned a greener future but has actualised it, growing from a mere idea to explore clean energy to achieving a phenomenal 10,000 MW in installed capacity. This achievement is a demonstration of the rapidity and scale at which the Adani Group aims to facilitate India's transition to clean, reliable and affordable energy,\" he said. \"In our drive towards 45,000 MW (45 GW) by 2030, we are building the world's largest renewable energy plant in Khavda -- a 30,000 MW project unparalleled on the global stage. AGEL is not just setting benchmarks for the world but redefining them,\" he said. P",

    "content": "Only 5 per cent of those looking to buy a four-wheeler in the country are likely to buy an electric car this year, according to a survey. The survey, based on the response of 40,000 people from across 319 districts, also found that more than half of the \"existing or prospective car owners\" are willing to buy an electric car if it is available in the Rs 8-10 lakh price range. Car sales in India crossed 4 million units last year while 72,321 electric four-wheelers were registered, according to the survey conducted by online consumer pulse aggregator platform, LocalCircles. Of the 40,000 respondents who participated in the survey -- conducted over a period of three months -- 42 per cent are from tier-1 cities, 34 per cent from tier 2 and the remaining 24 per cent from tier-3, 4 and rural areas, it said. About 21 per cent of the respondents flagged \"not enough electric car charging stations in my area/city/ town\", while 12 per cent said they \"don't know enough about these vehicles\", according to the survey, explaining the relatively low interest for e-four-wheelers. About 7 per cent of respondents indicated \"not enough choices of models within budget\", while 21 per cent felt e-cars are \"more expensive as compared to regular cars\", the survey said. The India findings from the \"2023 Global Automotive Consumer Study\" by Deloitte noted that the demand for EVs continues to centre on the consumer perception that fuel costs will be significantly lower than ICE cars, outweighing the concern for climate change, it said. Experts say people want to buy electric cars for the driving experience also as there is no engine sound and very little NVH (noise, vibrations, and harshness), which makes the cabin very quiet and comfortable, the platform stated. Automobile experts point out that while operating costs of an electric car are much less than a petrol version, the time taken to offset the difference in purchase cost would take an average commute of 46km/day, or six years. For an average commuter, according to the platform, the distance travelled daily would be considerably less than 46km, or 16,790 km annually.",

    "description": "Last week’s final close of Private Investment Partners 16 fund marks the first time a Tiger venture pool attracted less cash than the vintage that preceded it. Tiger Global VC fund closes 63% below target with $2.2 billionRelated stories",
    "content": "Tiger Global Management gathered about $2.2 billion for its latest venture-capital fund, well short of a $6 billion target and its smallest fundraising haul in roughly a decade, according to people familiar with the matter. Last week’s final close of Private Investment Partners 16 fund marks the first time a Tiger venture pool attracted less cash than the vintage that preceded it. That’s a stark reversal after years of robust investor demand, with Tiger raising successively bigger funds to back hundreds of startups annually. Tiger’s last fund of $12.7 billion was its largest ever. With firms slow to return cash, clients have limited ability to make new investments. Many private equity and venture firms have recently missed or cut their fundraising targets, including Apollo Global Management Inc., Carlyle Group Inc. and Insight Partners. It’s the latest in a series of challenges for Tiger. In November, the firm announced that founder Chase Coleman would take over for venture chief Scott Shleifer, who stepped down to become a senior adviser. Shleifer had led the push to rapidly invest just ahead of an industry downturn, which prompted the firm to mark down its VC portfolio by 33% in 2022 and an additional 6% last year. The giant PIP 15 fund in particular was marked down 18% at the end of September after the firm slashed valuations for multiple portfolio companies. Tiger’s early expectation was to raise $8 billion for PIP 16, but the firm told investors in October 2022 that it was targeting $6 billion. By the following February, it revised that to $5 billion, as higher interest rates squeezed Silicon Valley startups and spooked investors, the Wall Street Journal reported. As of June, PIP 16 had gathered $2.06 billion. A spokesperson for New York-based Tiger, which manages almost $50 billion, declined to comment.  PIP 16 will back startups mostly in enterprise technology with a focus on the US and India, making investments over multiple years. Tiger insiders — traditionally the biggest investors in their funds — are putting more of their own cash in PIP 16, accounting for about 20% of its assets, up from roughly 10% for the most recent funds. PIP 16 has been in the market for about 18 months — longer than what the firm has typically needed to lock down cash. It delayed the final close in part to give investors more time following Shleifer’s transition, one of the people said. Some clients also asked for a longer runway to sort out internal budgeting.",

    "content": "India's largest real estate investment trust, Embassy Office Parks, plans to raise up to $400 million from investors, two sources with direct knowledge said, as it looks to meet demand for office space from global and local giants. Embassy, which manages 45 million square feet (4.18 million square meters) of office parks, has clients including Google, Cisco and IBM who are bolstering their presence in the world's fifth biggest economy. The property group has appointed investment banks Morgan Stanley and India's Kotak to run the deal, which it expects to complete by June, said the sources, who did not want to be named because the talks are private. Commercial real estate is booming in India, with large local and global companies hiring in record numbers after the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, companies in India leased 61.6 million square feet of office space, and the year's last quarter saw record quarterly leasing, consultancy firm CBRE said. That's in contrast with markets such as the U.S., UK and Australia, where office occupancies have slumped with people working from home. Although companies in India too have 'hybrid' working models, many still need more office space to fit new hires and for back offices, which employ thousands. Embassy, Asia's biggest office REIT, aims to seek board approval in coming weeks for the deal, which it plans to carry out via a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP), a tool used by listed Indian companies to raise funds from mutual funds and other large institutions. With the boom in Indian office space, the deal is expected to attract foreign asset managers and mutual funds, said one of the sources with direct knowledge. Embassy and the banks did not respond to queries seeking comment. With properties in four cities - Pune, Mumbai, Bengaluru and the National Capital Region - Embassy has 245 occupants, mainly from the technology and financial services sectors. A large portion of those occupants are Fortune 500 companies. Private equity giant Blackstone, which used to own a controlling stake in Embassy, sold that down in recent years, fully exiting the company last year. Embassy's units have risen 17% the past year, more than India's two other listed REITs, but less than the broader NIFTY Realty index which has more than doubled in the same period. While Embassy focuses on offices, India's broader real estate space, including residential and warehousing is seeing growing interest from investors as demand and prices skyrocket. For the December quarter, Embassy's post-tax profit rose 6% to 2.3 billion rupees ($27.58 million) while its total income grew 5.3% to 9.8 billion rupees.",

    "content": "PepsiCo India on Tuesday said it will invest Rs 1,266 crore to set up a flavour manufacturing facility at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh as part of its expansion plans in the country. The plant spread over 22 acres, will play a significant role in scaling up PepsiCo's beverage production in India, generating employment and positively impacting the local economy, the company said in a statement. The construction of the upcoming plant is slated to start in 2024 and is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2026, it added. PepsiCo India Senior Vice President, Beverages George Kovoor said the new unit will be the company's second flavour manufacturing facility in India. \"We aim to ramp up the production of our beverages to meet the rising demand in the country. This strategic investment not only strengthens our dedication to providing the highest quality beverages to our consumers but also reinforces our responsibility to drive sustainable practices across our operations,\" Kovoor added. PepsiCo's first flavour manufacturing facility in India is in Channo, Punjab. PepsiCo India said in line with its global sustainability goals, the new manufacturing facility will operate entirely on renewable energy sources leading to a reduction in carbon footprint by an impressive 1.9 metric tonne per day. With zero liquid discharge technology, the plant aims to achieve approximately 90 per cent overall water efficiency, ensuring responsible management of water resources, and replenishing 100 per cent of the water used at the facility, the company said.",

    "content": "The Chatterjee Group (TCG) is in talks with local and global companies to partner with its majority-owned petrochemical firm Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) to build a more than $10 billion project in southern India, HPL's chief executive said. The private equity firm plans to build the oil-to-chemical project, capable of producing 3.5 million metric tons per year (tpy) of ethylene and propylene, at Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu by 2028 to 2029, Haldia CEO Navanit Narayan said on Monday, adding the project is expected to reach financial closure by the end of 2024. \"What we are producing as chemicals, we can add more value to it. There is a huge market because most of the chemicals we are looking at are imported into India. So the margins are much better,\" he said. The company wants to boost profits by locally producing specialty chemicals. In 2021, Haldia took over a moribund oil refinery project in Cuddalore from Nagarjuna Oil that was shut down after damage from a cyclone in 2011. The planned project was set to process 120,000 barrels per day of oil. Indian firms are boosting their petrochemical production capacity as the country's expanding economy raises the need for goods ranging from plastics to paints and chemicals such as monoethylene glycol, used for making textile fibre and polyester resins. While India's western part is \"crowded\" with petrochemical projects, the south lacks a large petrochemical project to meet regional demand, Narayan said. \"So, I think that definitely is a place to be and it's also a very economically developed part of the country. We clearly see that as an advantage,\" Narayan said. India's petrochemical consumption is about one-third of the global average and the nation relies heavily on imports for meeting its specialty chemicals needs. \"Our assessment is that India needs a cracker of global scale every 18 months because we are growing at more than 7%-8% annually as an industry,\" he said.",

    "content": "Booster shot Pfizer's shares were among the big gainers on Monday. The stock saw unusually high volumes last Wednesday and Thursday. One theory is that there was a fat finger trade on Wednesday, which then had to be squared up the following day. What makes this theory less plausible is that the stock price did not see any unusual volatility on both days despite the heavy volumes. There is chatter that another big block is likely to change hands shortly. Some brokers are said to have begun sounding HNIs for their interest in participating in the deal.  Some of the old hands on Dalal Street are said to be accumulating shares of Container Corporation (Concor). The stock had fallen out of favour with the Street last year when the Adani group got into trouble over the Hindenburg report. That is because the Adani group was widely tipped as the frontrunner for buying a strategic stake in the company through the government’s divestment process. Concor’s financials have not seen any major improvement over the last three quarters, but the Adani group’s fortunes have improved considerably during this period. Contra call? PPFAS Mutual Fund was prompt in clarifying that its purchase of 6.2 million shares in the company was part of a arbitrage deal. Meaning, the fund had sold Zee futures and bought an equivalent quantity of shares, thereby pocketing the spread (the difference between the futures and spot market price). Still, the impression in the market seems to be that PPFAS has taken a contrarian view on the stock. That could possibly explain the 6 percent jump in stock price. Some of the entities holding concentrated positions used the frenzy in the stock to square up their positions. At the end of the trading session on Monday, 10 entities together held around 40 percent of the market wide position limit (MWPL) in Zee. On Thursday, the corresponding figures were 14 entities holding close to 60 percent of the MWPL. Value unlocking story HNIs who already owned shares in Bajaj Finserv are learnt to have increased their exposure over the last few trading sessions. An immediate trigger for the sudden interest could be Bajaj Finserv’s 52 percent arm Bajaj Finance initiating talks to take its wholly-owned subsidiary Bajaj Housing Finance public.  Market chatter is that these HNIs have been given to understand by friendly circles that there could be further ‘value unlocking’ moves in the days ahead, given the stakes that it holds in multiple group companies. Holding companies look more valuable in a bull market, as the value of their listed arms appreciate and market assigns fancy estimates for the unlisted arms. But investors looking for easy gains would do well to remember that the ‘value unlocking’ stories take their own sweet time to fructify.",

    "content": "Renewed interest The big boys of the HNI club on Dalal Street are back at work in the BSE stock. After a stellar run between June and December last year, BSE's shares had been struggling for direction till a couple of weeks back. The story that BSE will wrest market share from NSE in the F\u0026O segment has already been bought into. The theory being floated now is that the NSE’s IPO is likely to happen this year, and that could trigger another round of re-rating. Institutional holdings have already trebled between March end and December end last year. Bulls among HNIs may be wary of pushing the story too hard unless there are new believers at fund houses. Given the steep appreciation in the stock price, there are enough fund managers looking to take some money off the table.  Operators are said to be creating a positive buzz around steel stocks. It has worked in the case of Tata Steel, but the efforts in SAIL have not paid off so far. Two previous attempts have come a cropper, and a third one is underway. Many are viewing steel as a hope trade, as much depends on which way China’s economy turns. But operators appear to be betting that under ownership of the stock by fund managers may work to their advantage. Booster shot Wockhardt's shares are on a tear after some of the big names of D-Street subscribed to the company’s Rs 480-crore QIP issue. But quite a few reputed investors also stayed away from the issue, saying risk-reward no longer seemed attractive after a near fourfold rise in the stock price in less than a year. That could partly explain why the QIP size was smaller than the figure doing the rounds till last month. Also, skeptics point to the dwindling trading volumes in the stock over the last month. Go slow Operators are said to be cautious of going overboard on PSU stocks, and in fact have been steadily trimming positions which are still hugely profitable. They had anticipated correctly that no major divestments would be announced in the interim Budget. But the Budget coming up in July could well turn out to be a different ball game. Chatter is that the government will most likely increase the size of its divestment target. Good for the government’s book of accounts, but bad news for those holding a lot of PSU stock.",

    "content": "Always by your side Things have not gone well for Valor Estate (erstwhile D B Realty) since the time it announced its qualified institutional placement (QIP). The deal happened at a 5 percent discount to the floor price, and failed to draw marquee investors. Bears took that as a signal and began hammering the stock. What appears to have given further ammunition to the bears is Pinnacle Investments selling 3 million shares last week. Pinnacle is the family office of Prestige Estate group promoter Irfan Razack and CEO Venkat K Narayana. The Razack Family Trust is a key shareholder in DB with a 15 percent stake. An unusual clarification from Pinnacle followed, in which it reiterated its long term commitment to the company despite selling a part of its holdings. That has fallen on deaf ears for now, as the stock climbed to a high of Rs 207 during the day on Wednesday, March 27,  but slipped to Rs 198 at close. It is now down 30 percent in less than two weeks since hitting a 13-year high. The fact that realty stocks in general are holding ground in a choppy market is making the Street wonder what is giving bears the confidence to go after Valor. Especially considering the buoyancy in the Mumbai real estate market. Retail shareholders of ICICI Securities must be surprised why most institutional investors are not sharing their outrage over the proposal to merge ICICI Securities with ICICI Bank. Mutual funds may have become a dominant force, but they too need to choose their battles carefully. Opposing the merger would mean getting a better value for their ICICI Securities holdings. But then they also need to consider other factors like access to management, ICICI Bank’s distribution might, and the bank’s treasury funds that could flow into their debt schemes. As the saying goes, discretion is the better part of valour. NAV prop desk Among the annual rituals of Dalal Street is the net asset value (NAV) propping game. And thanks to ever rising SIP flows every month, the task appears to have been less  challenging than in some of the previous years. Fund managers wanting to show a shiny NAV at the end of the financial year are known to increase exposure to key holdings with an aim to boost the stock price. This could also include buying blocks at inflated prices from friendly brokers and then transferring it back at nearly the same price a few days later. This time the operations have been spread over 2-3 trading sessions, brokers say. Reason: A regulator who knows the ways of the market, having walked that path before. Change in stance Liberty Shoes has written to the stock exchanges seeking a change in the classification of two of its promoter group entities to public shareholders. Market chatter is that this could be the first step towards a reconciliation between the warring Gupta and Bansal families which are part of the promoter group. In December, rating agency Care Edge had placed Liberty Shoes under rating watch, citing the dispute between the promoters as the reason.  Liberty has exclusive long-term agreements with three group firms Liberty Group Marketing Division (LGMD), Liberty Enterprises (LE), and Liberty Footwear Co. (LFC), for business and intellectual property rights. Following the removal of Adesh Gupta as CEO of the company, the above three entities controlled by the Gupta family, have issued termination notices for the agreement.",

    "content": "IndiGo aims to double in size by 2030 with new domestic and international routes as well as destinations, its chief Pieter Elbers said as the airline pursues soaring global ambitions to match India's economic growth potential. The country's largest airline with a domestic market share of little over 60 per cent is also betting big on A321 XLR aircraft that are expected to be part of its fleet \"somewhere in 2025\", to further expand its overseas presence. Seeking to consolidate as well as expand its position on the global scale, Elbers told PTI in an interview that the next big jump for IndiGo will be to double its size by the end of the decade. Amid supply chain as well as Pratt \u0026 Whitney engine woes, Elbers also emphasised that the airline is taking a lot of mitigating measures that are bearing fruits, and that the Aircraft on Ground (AOG) situation is \"stable\". In February, the airline said the number of AOGs was in the mid-70s. Currently, the 17-year-old carrier operates to 88 domestic and 33 international destinations. It has a fleet of more than 360 planes. \"An airline with double of today's size, global reach and footprint by the year 2030. That is the ambitious target...,\" Elbers said and added that more codeshare partnerships can be expected. At present, IndiGo has codeshares with Turkish Airways, British Airways, Qatar Airways, American Airline, KLM-AirFrance, Qantas, Jetstar, and Virgin Atlantic. Codesharing allows an airline to book its passengers on its partner carriers and provide seamless travel to various destinations. \"Clearly, going forward, we will be seeing a number of new international destinations. We will have some domestic but more international... I would say. Especially, the opportunity to have more international routes, not per se destinations only,\" he said and cited the example of services to Singapore that have been increased. About a year ago, he said that IndiGo was flying to Singapore from three destinations and today, it operates to that country from seven destinations in India. \"I think we have a good opportunity to not only add destinations but even more... adding more routes to our network\". A mixture of new domestic and international routes will be a key element in the airline's pursuit to double its size by 2030, for which the \"groundwork\" has been done. In December 2023, IndiGo announced carrying 100 million passengers in a calendar year, becoming the first airline to achieve the milestone. \"We should compare IndiGo to the global aviation landscape. India (set to become the third largest economy in the world), should and will have airlines matching the ambition of the country itself. So, 100 million was our target to be part of the top ten airlines in the world and today, we are the seventh largest in terms of daily departures...,\" Elbers said. According to Elbers, IndiGo is determined to play a very strong role in India having a strong aviation ecosystem. \"If home is the world's most populous nation and home is soon going to be the third largest economy in the world, India should have an aviation ecosystem that is matching the size, potential and ambition of the country. IndiGo is determined to play a very strong role in that,\" he noted. After being hit by the coronavirus pandemic, the carrier has got its financials back on track and has remained profitable in the last five quarters, also turning networth positive in the 2023 December quarter. \"Where do we stand today? We have actually created the groundwork for what may be called the next big mission of IndiGo. That is to double in size towards the end of the decade. You can only have that ambition if your foundations are correct. \"The foundations are important from a financial perspective, customer perspective, network perspective as also the big fleet order which we made in June last year. That gives us long-term visibility well into the next decade,\" the IndiGo chief said. To a query on whether the airline will be going for wide-body planes and also introducing new classes, Elbers said, \"we keep all options open and we evaluate, we take decisions for IndiGo that are matching the needs of the market and IndiGo at the appropriate time\". Further, he highlighted that A321 XLR aircraft, that are expected to come into its fleet \"somewhere in 2025\", will help the airline in further expanding its range. \"XLRs will bring us to parts of Europe, Asia and places like Athens, Seoul, Rome... that will be a wonderful expansion of IndiGo,\" he added. The airline has more than 900 planes on order. At the end of December 2023, the carrier had a fleet of 358 aircraft, including 31 A320 ceos (11 damp lease), 184 A320 neos, 94 A321 neos, 44 ATRs, 3 A321 freighters and 2 B777s.",

    "content": "Billionaire Gautam Adani's group is building the world's largest renewable energy park in Gujarat, as it eyes a massive 45 GW capacity to generate electricity largely from solar energy. Speaking at the opening of 'Energy Revolution: The Adani Green Energy Gallery' at the Science Museum in London, Gautam Adani said his group's renewable energy arm, Adani Green Energy, is leading an energy transition that honours the commitment of taking care of the planet not just for this generation and the next but also for generations to come. \"As the world's leading solar power developer and India's largest renewable energy company, we are taking very big steps,\" he said. \"This will be like providing clean energy to almost every house in England,\" he said. It currently has an operating renewable portfolio of over 9.5 GW and locked-in projects of up to 21.8 Gigawatt (GW). The Gallery explores how the world can generate and use energy more sustainably to urgently decarbonise and to limit dangerous climate change. \"Through striking displays of contemporary and historic objects from the UK and abroad, interactive digital exhibits, and specially commissioned models, the gallery shows how the past, present and future are shaped by human imagination and innovation and explores how we all have a role to play in deciding our energy future,\" a company statement said. The Gallery, which is open to the public for free, examines this century's defining challenge through the lens of imagination across three sections. In Future Planet, visitors can explore how scientists use complex computer-based models to understand our planet, and what these tell us about the range of climate futures that might lie ahead. In Future Energy, technologies and the people behind them that are reimagining how energy is supplied and used are highlighted alongside historic artefacts which provide a longer view of the transition away from fossil fuels. Adani said museums are very important because they teach and inspire. \"This new gallery is about more than just clean air - or about moving away from oil and gas. It is about the energy transition we need - this world needs - and it is about the revolution that is taking place in the world of energy.\" The gallery, he said, was special because it makes us think, dream and wish for change. At the centre of the gallery is Only Breath, a moving sculpture that signifies the power of nature to inspire technological change. Radiating outward from the centre are plinths which display vital low-carbon renewable energy technologies for the transition, from nuclear, hydrogen and solar to wind and tidal power, alongside remarkable historic innovations that remind us how major change is possible and that many of the technologies needed to make the low-carbon energy transition already exist. Objects in this section include a 7m long tidal turbine blade made by Scottish renewable energy company Orbital Marine Power and the first electric taxi, the Bersey cab, hailed by Londoners in 1897. The challenges of electrification, energy storage, and supply and demand are also explored, with visitors invited to play interactive games and use models that show how energy can be generated and distributed. Possible routes to low-carbon transport are featured, as well the decarbonisation of our buildings and construction industries, and visitors can learn about climate modelling and see instruments used to measure climate.Energy Revolution was designed by award-winning architects, Unknown Works.A key element of sustainable design was the reuse of redundant shelves from the Science Museum's former object store. The gallery's carbon footprint has been monitored, and recyclable aluminium was used where possible.The gallery's Title Funder is Adani Green Energy.Sagar Adani, Executive Director, AGEL, said, \"The Science Museum has put together the world's best curated gallery on energy transition. As one of the world's largest renewable energy companies, we are committed to making progress towards net zero - and there is no greater resource in the fight against climate change than education.\"Through the sponsorship of the gallery, we aim to inspire young minds, scientists and innovators to imagine a future powered by clean energy and build a carbon-free world. It is an initiative to stimulate their interest, curiosity and awareness, and encourage their active participation in creating clean technologies. The gallery brings together the global community to enable the shift towards energy efficiency, clean energy adoption and carbon emissions reduction.\" Sir Ian Blatchford, Director and Chief Executive of the Science Museum Group, said, \"In a week when we're celebrating a record 2.25 million visits by UK residents to the museum, including a million children, this stunning gallery offers even more to ignite curiosity among those who will visit in the year ahead - provoking important conversations about the urgent need for the world to generate and use energy more sustainably.\"",

The budget carrier expects capacity to grow in the “early double digits” next year, with a similar rate of increase in the number of passengers it flies, it said in an analyst presentation Friday.

    "content": "German automaker Volkswagen has unveiled the maiden electric vehicle (EV) in India, the Volkswagen ID.4, which is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of the calendar year (CY) 2024. The Volkswagen ID.4 will be brought into the Indian market as a completely built-up (CBU) model and will be initially available in a single configuration. Globally, the Volkswagen ID.4 gets multiple powertrain options, including single-motor rear-wheel-drive and dual-motor all-wheel-drive, in the international markets. The EV has a claimed range of up to 480km on a single full charge. \"Our first step to the electrification journey in India begins with the ID.4...,\" executive director sales international operations, Volkswagen Passenger Cars Michael Mayer said at the Volkswagen annual brand conference. He said the ID.4 is being brought in as part of the company's global efforts of mass electrification. At present, the German carmaker offers Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) models like the Virtus mid-size sedan, Taigun mid-size SUV and the Tiguan premium SUV in India. Globally, VW is leading in the electrification journey, Mayer said, adding, as part of the company's commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement 2030, it is continuing efforts in various spheres, including the development of charging infrastructure that's key to acceptance of EVs, recycling ofbatteries, digitalisation and connectivity solutions. The company is offering different products from ID.2 to ID. Buzz globally targeting several segments of customers, Mayer said, adding that globally, VW's electric vehicle (EV) sales grew 21% at around 4 lakh units in 2023. One of the brand’s most popular EVs in the global market, the ID.4 is offered in multiple trims worldwide and sits below the ID.3 hatchback in the brand’s global portfolio. The car will be Volkswagen’s first BEV to be offered for sale in India. Volkswagen previously showcased the ID.4 GTX in India at their annual brand conference in 2023. \"This is not the end of the story. It is our goal to take this success to other markets,\" Mayer said. However, he added, \"This would be a phased approach, wherein we will strengthen our current portfolio on the basis of brand positioning for the market.\" \"India, needless to say, continues to be a key market for Volkswagen. India is a 4 million car market now and is expected to grow 5-7% this year,\" he asserted. The Indian automotive industry is now ranked third in the world even surpassing Japan, Mayer said, adding, \"Who would have thought it ten years back?\" He said VW is committed to the Indian market and the company will continue to introduce its premium products over the next few years. Volkswagen Passenger Cars India brand director Ashish Gupta said the company's sales grew 8% in 2023. The company had sold around 44,000 units. \"Our target this year in 2024 is to increase it by 10-15%,\" he added.

    "content": "Reliance Industries, operator of the world's biggest refining complex, will not buy Russian oil loaded on tankers operated by shipper Sovcomflot (SCF) after recent U.S. sanctions, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The development adds to oil export problems for Russia as its oil firms may face difficulties finding ships to sell surplus oil after recent Ukrainian drone attacks on the state's refineries. Russian companies are already struggling to collect payments for oil exports due to banking restrictions. The U.S. has imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine two years ago. In February, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Sovcomflot and 14 crude oil tankers involved in Russian oil transportation. Sovcomflot and Reliance representatives didn't respond to Reuters' requests for comment. Meanwhile, more Indian refiners plan to shun the use of Sovcomflot vessels, which may weigh on India's import of Russian oil and leave Russia with fewer outlets to place its flagship product, three sources in India's government and refining sector said. Indian refiners, seeking to avoid any backlash from Washington, are being \"extra cautious\" due to tighter scrutiny of Russian oil deals by banks and U.S. authorities. The refiners want to prevent the involvement of entities that are directly or indirectly sanctioned, the sources said. \"Our preference is that refiners should not take oil in sanctioned vessels, because of our political and commercial interests and the U.S. sanctions,\" one of the sources in India's government said. The source added that the government would decide on the entry of the sanctioned vessels or Sovcomflot ships to Indian ports. India oil and shipping ministries did not respond to Reuters request for comments. Since October last year, the United States has imposed a raft of sanctions on entities, shippers, traders, and vessels for violating a price cap on Russian oil. One of the refining sources said that India's crude imports from Russian may decline as the number of vessels would be reduced and that could jack up freight costs. \"SCF actively offer their vessels, but traders are wary of fixing any as buyers and even ports may reject the cargo\", one trader in the Russian oil market said, adding that more Sovcomflot vessels were committed for voyages to China now.

    "content": "Block trades in India are close to capping their best quarter in 14 years as the country’s booming stock market encourages shareholders to monetize stakes. Shareholders have raised $7.1 billion selling their holdings in India so far this year, with the quarter on track to have raised the most from block trades since the January to March period in 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. India’s equity capital markets have been running hot for the past year as its stocks climb to record highs and foreign investors pile in amid a rotation away from China, which has been mired in an economic slowdown. More foreign inflows are likely to come after the nation’s general elections starting next month, with the country’s growth prospects providing a catalyst. “With elections over, there could be another round of block trades or sell-downs. Domestic liquidity and foreign appetite remain very strong for Indian assets,” said Rahul Saraf, Citigroup’s India head of investment banking. The election results will be tallied on June 4. With one of the world’s fastest rates of economic growth and relative political stability, Indian equities have soared, with the benchmark Sensex Index notching eight years of annual gains. The euphoria has prompted companies in India to go public at the fastest pace on record, as well as encouraging a continuous flow of additional share sales by listed firms since the start of the year. The flurry of activity contrasts with a slowdown in other parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and China, where a mix of economic growth woes and lower valuations have kept sellers on the sidelines. There hasn’t been a block larger than $500 million in mainland China or Hong Kong since July, Bloomberg-compiled data show. “We are only in March, but ECM activity in India has been very active with volumes already equaling more than 50 percent of last year, largely dominated by blocks,” said Kailash Soni, executive director responsible for Indian equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “Despite elections looming on the horizon, markets are not expecting uncertainty during that time,” he added. This week, Tata Sons Ltd. raised the equivalent of $1.1 billion through the sale of shares in the group’s software services unit Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. It’s the largest block involving shares of the software services unit since 2018, data compiled by Bloomberg show. British American Tobacco Plc last week raised almost 175 billion rupees from the sale of a 3.5% stake in its Indian partner ITC Ltd. for Asia’s largest block trade of 2024. That followed an upsized $820 million stake sale in India’s biggest airline IndiGo by its co-founder, who cashed in as the stock neared a record high. US home appliance giant Whirlpool Corp. sold part of its stake in its Indian unit in February, raising $469 million. It joined a number of foreign firms monetizing their Indian businesses to take advantage of the high valuations. Investors have mostly welcomed the stake sales. ITC’s shares surged the most in almost four years after BAT’s disposal and were trading above the offer price last week. IndiGo’s shares have climbed almost 8% above the price at which Rakesh Gangwal sold them in the block trade.",

Recently, India reduced import taxes on specific electric vehicles for carmakers investing at least $500 million and starting domestic manufacturing within three years. This policy change is beneficial for Tesla, facilitating its entry into the Indian market. Despite potential increased competition, analysts suggest that the impact on domestic vehicle sales may be limited to manufacturers of higher-priced vehicles. Electric vehicle sales comprised approximately 2 percent of total car sales in India in 2023, with the government aiming for a 30 percent share by 2030.",

India’s aviation boom could support more hubs: Air India CEO Campbell WilsonRelated stories",
    "content": "India’s airline industry is growing so fast that the country could support at least one other international hub beyond Mumbai and Delhi, Campbell Wilson, the chief executive officer of Air India Ltd., said. “India can be home to at least three hubs and plenty of point-to-point services,” Wilson said at an industry event in Gurugram on Wednesday. “There aren’t many other markets like India in the world. Northern India has a good east to west flow, while southern India can offer an Asia to Africa or Australia-Europe flow.” Air India last year signed one of the largest-ever jet purchases in aviation history, ordering 470 aircraft from Airbus SE and Boeing Co. The world’s most-populous nation is characterized by a booming consumer class and economic growth that could transform it into one of the world’s largest travel markets. Air India has taken delivery of one new aircraft every six days over the past six months and will continue to receive the same over the next 12 months. This month, it’s received 11 new Boeing 777s, three Airbus A350s and about 15 Boeing 737 Maxs, Wilson said. He added that the retrofitting of existing widebodies should be complete by the end of 2025 or 2026. “At the time of privatization, Air India had 43 wide-body aircraft for a population of 1.3 billion,” he said. “Singapore had 150 wide-body aircraft, Dubai had 250. That gives you a sense of how grossly underserved the Indian market was by Indian airlines.” As part of parent Tata Group’s plan to transform Air India, low-cost carriers Air India Express and AIX Connect will be merged into one entity, and Air India and Vistara will be combined into another. Earlier this month, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore approved the merger between Air India and Vistara, a joint venture between Singapore Airlines Ltd. and the Tata Group. Singapore Airlines will get a 25.1% share in the enlarged entity, Wilson said on Wednesday.

Air India’s transformation program, which includes a rebranding campaign to freshen the carrier’s image, has now been underway for the past 18 months. While the first six months was spent mainly on addressing past issues, over the last year, the focus has been on putting in place systems, people, processes and equipment, Wilson said. “We’ve injected nearly 5,000 people in the last 18 months, which has brought down the average age from 54 to 35 years,” Wilson said, adding that the airline’s IT systems had to be rebuilt from scratch when Tata Group took over from the government.",

BPCL is expected to process more crude in the next fiscal year starting in April compared with the current year, when it had shut its 156,000 bpd Bina refinery in central India for a month for maintenance. It had also shut units at its 120,000 bpd Mumbai refinery for maintenance. BPCL did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comments.",

    "content": "Luxury automaker Audi India is looking to commence local assembly of electric vehicles, a move which would help it roll out models at an affordable price helping expand its customer base in the country. The automaker currently imports its entire EV range comprising Q8 50 e-tron, Q8 55 e-tron, Q8 Sportback 50 e-tron, Q8 Sportback 55 e-tron, e-tron GT, and RS e-tron GT, into the country. It, however, assembles petrol models like Q3, Q3 Sportback, Q5, Q7, A4, and A6 at its Aurangabad (Maharashtra) based manufacturing plant. \"We are working with Audi AG very positively and hopefully at some point in time we will be able to announce this (local assembly of EV models),\" he noted. When asked about the expected timeline of commencing the process, Dhillon did not share any specific date but stated that the India unit is discussing the matter with the global headquarters very \"positively\". \"Hopefully we should have some solution at some point in time. That is the time when you can reach even more (set of customers) because then you will get the best advantage in terms of price point,\" he said. He further said, \"I think the next 2-3 years will be very crucial (2024-2026). These years will see many more new electric cars coming at different price points. Then I think our reach to our existing customers or first-time buyers will go up.\" The company's current EV model lineup is priced over Rs 1 crore thus serving a very niche set of customers. Currently, cars imported into India as Completely Built Units (CBUs) attract customs duty ranging from 60 per cent to 100 per cent. The country's customs duty system treats electric cars and hydrocarbon-powered vehicles equally, imposing significant tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing. Audi, globally, is looking to introduce multiple electric models in the next 2-3 years many of which would also come to India thus helping the Indian operations to choose which ones to localise. In order to rev up sales volume, Audi India would look out for models which sit below the current range in price terms. The company currently gets around 2 per cent of its total sales from EVs. It reported 89 per cent growth in retail sales in India at 7,931 units last year as compared with a total of 4,187 units in 2022. Audi on Monday evening globally premiered the Q6 e-tron, a new EV model which would sit below the Q8 e-tron range. To be manufactured at the company's Ingolstadt plant, the model is expected to roll out in various markets globally this year. It is also expected to make its way to Indian shores early next year. Dhillon said the model would help in widening the company's customer base in India. \"That's the expectation that our penetration in electric mobility should go up with this model (Q6 e-tron),\" he noted. Audi expects 50 per cent of its sales in India to come from electric vehicles by 2030. Globally, Audi has decided to become a fully electric vehicle manufacturer from 2033 onwards. The Q6 e-tron is the first production model on the company's Premium Platform Electric (PPE), marking the next step in the company's transformation into a provider of premium electric mobility. The electric SUV will be available to order from this month with deliveries expected to customers in the third quarter of 2024. The Q6 e-tron comes with a range of up to 625 kms. \"The PPE shows how we are pooling expertise within the Volkswagen Group and thus making electric mobility scalable,\" Audi AG Chairman of the Board of Management Gernot Dollner said. Thanks to the PPE, the company is able to launch high-volume models with high technical standards in different segments, he added.",

The rules also modify the affiliate test required to map overlaps between the parties to the M\u0026A transaction. \"This will reduce the regulatory burden of the CCI as well as provide a big relief to the parties involved in M\u0026As,\" he added.

    "title": "Warehouse developers bet on India as companies look beyond China",
    "description": "\"It is one of the most wanted places in India for European and American companies,\" said S. Raghuraman, an official of the Greenbase industrial park, near plants run by Apple supplier Foxconn and truckmaker Daimler.Warehouse developers bet on India as companies look beyond ChinaRelated stories",
    "content": "Land is getting hard to find in a sprawling industrial park in southern India where workers are scrambling to build modern new warehouses and factories for companies betting on the country's economic boom or diversifying their supply chains beyond China. \"It is one of the most wanted places in India for European and American companies,\" said S. Raghuraman, an official of the Greenbase industrial park, near plants run by Apple supplier Foxconn and truckmaker Daimler. Inquiries for leasing space in the park, run by Blackstone and real estate tycoon Niranjan Hiranandani, have gone through the roof, he added. To meet the burgeoning demand, Greenbase aims to invest $800 million to quadruple its industrial park space to 20 million sq ft (1.9 million sq m), a target it revealed for the first time. That is just the latest sign of a rush for leased warehouse space that peaked in the last quarter of 2023 at its highest in two years, says real estate firm Colliers, as India's economic growth of more than 8% outstrips advanced nations. Businesses in India have traditionally relied on dingy, stuffy low-rise sheds known as godowns for their storage needs, but these are unsuited to the needs of foreign industrial giants whose investment Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to lure. So developers such as Greenbase are scouting for land nationwide, grappling with thorny acquisition issues, as they line up millions of dollars in new investment. Prime targets are firms looking to expand manufacturing facilities beyond China as tension with the United States and other countries takes off some of its shine. Companies in the booming e-commerce and manufacturing industries also see India as a hub for exports while looking to boost sales to industries and domestic consumers amid a population of 1.4 billion. \"We thought this is the right moment to enter India as there is a huge potential runway for growth over the next 15 to 20 years,\" said Sandeep Chanda, the India managing director of one of the world's biggest developers, U.S.-based Panattoni. One lure has been spanking new facilities, from ports to highways, added in an $808-billion infrastructure splurge over the last seven years, boosting connectivity and putting the spotlight on previously overlooked plots of land. In a 100-million-euro ($109-million) plan, Panattoni is building its first warehouse complex near the capital, New Delhi, playing up its access to expressways and a rail freight corridor. It plans to strike land deals for four more parks within a year. And Chanda sees room to grow, saying India leases just 45 million sq ft (4 million sq m) of new warehouses a year, a fraction of the 200 million sq ft (19 million sq m) in China. Avendus Capital estimates China has three times more than India's 412 million sq ft (38 million sq m) of the \"Grade A\" warehouses, fitted with automated storage and retrieval systems, that industries from e-commerce to engineering favour. By comparison, Blackstone says the United States has 13 billion square feet (1.2 billion sq m) of warehousing stock. CHINA ALTERNATIVE Colliers says the 7.7 million square ft (715,000 sq. m.) of warehouse space leased in the last quarter of 2023 in the top five Indian cities it tracks was the highest in the last two years. During that period, the supply of \"Grade A\" warehouses rose 336% in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai, near the Greenbase park, for the highest growth among the five cities and outperforming the group's average of 55%. Colliers expects automobile, engineering, retail and e-commerce companies to drive further growth. Danish wind turbine maker Vestas just added 20% more space to its assembly and warehouse operations at Greenbase, said Raghuraman, adding that though China is the firm's main hub, \"They want to make India an alternative.\" Vestas \"continuously matures and evolves our global supply chain network and manufacturing footprint,\" it said. Prologis, the world's largest warehouse owner, has returned to India after ending an initial foray in 2007, when it found the market \"too challenging\". Now the company is focusing on \"high-growth, high-consumption\" areas, said Joseph Ghazal, its chief investment officer. \"India has seen strong economic growth, and we believe there is a high level of demand.\" While developers zero in on big cities and warehouses, Bahrain-based Investcorp is taking the opposite tack by betting on smaller warehouses, said Gaurav Sharma, its India investment head. Investcorp plans to raise about $120 million for a fund to partner with developers and build up to eight warehouses in India, a strategy that Reuters is the first to report. But developers often find they first have to resolve complex land issues. India's infrastructure drive fuels high demand for land, leaving few plots in good locations, so that surging prices hit developers' returns as rentals fall behind, executives said. Real estate consultants CBRE say land prices around the Greenbase park rose a fifth in 2023 to $3.6 million for 10 acres (4 hectares), or an area half the size of Buckingham Palace, with increases of more than 50% for some plots near New Delhi. Sometimes a single piece of land can have as many as 50 owners. Panattoni needed eight months to complete acquisition formalities for its complex near the capital. \"Land takes its own sweet time,\" Chanda said, referring to the period spent untangling ownership concerns.",

The development comes a year after short-seller Hindenburg Research accused Adani of fraud and market manipulation, charges denied by the conglomerate. Related stories",
    "content": "Several of Adani Group’s dollar bonds fell the most in more than half a year, after news that US prosecutors have widened their probe of the port-to-power conglomerate to focus on whether it may have engaged in bribery. Most of the group’s shares declined. A note from unit Adani Ports \u0026 Special Economic Zone Ltd. due in 2041 slid 2.4 cents, the most since August, to 79.1 cents. Another bond from subsidiary Adani Renewable Energy RJ Ltd. due 2039 fell 2.3 cents to 83 cents, the worst drop since February 2023. That pares gains in recent months that sent the securities to their highest levels since 2022. Flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd. was among biggest decliners, falling as much as 5%. Shares of other group companies dropped in the range of 3%-8% before paring some of those losses.  US investigators are digging into whether an Adani entity, or people linked to the company including Gautam Adani, were involved in paying officials in India for favorable treatment on an energy project, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The probe, which is also looking at Indian renewable energy company Azure Power Global Ltd., is being handled by the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Justice Department’s fraud unit in Washington, said people familiar with the matter. “We are not aware of any investigation against our chairman,” Adani Group said in an emailed statement. “As a business group that operates with the highest standards of governance, we are subject to and fully compliant with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in India and other countries.” Gautam Adani, his company and Azure haven’t been charged with wrongdoing by the Justice Department, and investigations don’t always lead to prosecutions. Adani’s sprawling empire was rocked early last year by claims from short-seller Hindenburg Research that the conglomerate manipulated its stock price and committed accounting fraud. The group has vigorously denied those allegations and the shares have largely climbed back from their initial plunge. Still, the report prompted the Justice Department, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission, to look into some of the claims, Bloomberg News reported last year. While the probe from US prosecutors will cast a shadow on the group, investor sentiment toward its firms has continued to improve as it trimmed debt, pared founders’ share pledges and successfully sold a dollar bond earlier this month. The combined market value of Adani Group’s listed firms has more than doubled to about $190 billion from last year’s lows. It is still more than $40 billion short of the level seen prior to Hindenburg’s wide-ranging allegations.",

    "content": "A U.S. bankruptcy judge on Thursday ordered the arrest of William Cameron Morton, a hedge fund manager who allegedly helped Indian education technology startup Byju's hide $533 million from its lenders. Byju's Alpha, a subsidiary controlled by Byju's lenders, filed for U.S. bankruptcy in February after the Bangalore-based startup defaulted on $1.2 billion in debt. While seeking repayment, the lenders discovered that Byju's had sent $533 million to Morton's \"unknown and unproven hedge fund\" Camshaft Capital, Byju's court filings showed. Dorsey had previously ordered Morton to appear in court to explain where the funds were being held. Morton told the court he was unavailable because he was hospitalized in a foreign country, but Dorsey said at a Thursday court hearing in Wilimington, Delaware, that excuse was not credible. \"Given his absolute contempt for this court, I don't believe him,\" Dorsey said. Dorsey issued a warrant for Morton's arrest and said he and Camshaft would be fined $10,000 per day until they complied with court orders to cooperate with the investigation into Byju's missing funds. \"He certainly has the financial ability to pay those fines,\" Dorsey said. \"He knows the location of half a billion in the debtors' funds.\" Morton could not immediately be reached for comment. An attorney for Camshaft declined to comment. In a lawsuit against Morton and Camshaft, Byju's lenders said the startup had never explained why it sent so much money to Morton, who is in his mid-twenties and had \"no apparent qualification to manage a hedge fund.\" Camshaft had no other significant business, and the address it listed in filings as its primary business location turned out an International House of Pancakes in Miami, the lenders said. Byju's former parent company, Think \u0026 Learn Private Ltd, was once valued at $22 billion, they added.",

    "content": "About 22 miles southeast of Mumbai’s badly congested airport that opened 82 years back, workers in hard hats are high up on scaffolds building an alternative. Others are flattening a nearby hill to finish the first of two runways so that India’s financial capital can finally have a second airport. In many ways, the Adani Group-helmed $2.1 billion project in the satellite city of Navi Mumbai is a microcosm of the massive infrastructure overhaul underway in India as its Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to outrun China. For Gautam Adani, it’s a test of whether he can put India on the global aviation map. The airport, with a lotus-shaped design mimicking India’s national flower as well as the election symbol for Modi’s party, should start operations in March next year with capacity for 20 million passengers a year. That will ramp up to 90 million by 2032 if there’s enough demand, according to Arun Bansal, the chief executive officer of Adani Airport Holdings Ltd., India’s largest private sector airport operator that also runs the existing Mumbai airport. “Geographically, India is in a very advantageous situation,” he said. “There’s hardly any country where you can’t fly within 12 hours.” A wave of plane deals and airport buildouts can aid that ambition. Air India Ltd., IndiGo and upstart Akasa have ordered more than 1,100 aircraft, combined. The world’s most-populous nation is also plowing $12 billion into building more than 72 new airports by 2025.  Navi Mumbai airport is one of two landmark infrastructure projects in the city that will test the mettle of Adani, the mining-to-media conglomerate that survived a withering short-seller attack last year. The other is the redevelopment of the Dharavi slum in the heart of Mumbai, which served as a backdrop for acclaimed movie, Slumdog Millionaire. It’s one of the world’s largest and densest slum clusters where families of six often live in 100-square tenements and 80 may share a toilet. Global LogisticsProjects like these are crucial to Modi’s vision of India becoming a developed nation by 2047. But it’s not going to be easy. Similar to how Adani is trying to get a larger slice of the global logistics market — the group started a first-of-its-kind transshipment port in October at India’s southernmost tip to beckon world’s biggest container ships — Navi Mumbai airport is attempting a redux of that in air passenger traffic. However, it’s up against stiff competition from the likes of Singapore’s Changi Airport or London’s Heathrow, which ferried almost 59 million and 79 million passengers last year respectively. What’s more, London has six major airports, while New York City has three, signaling how far Mumbai has to go to catch up.  The new facility will also need to have ample flights slotted in and ensure people and checked-in bags move fast enough in case of short layovers, according to Mabel Kwan, managing director at Alton Aviation Consultancy. There have to be on-ground amenities for fliers with longer layovers, too. Emirates, Qatar Airways QCSC and Singapore Airlines Ltd., which all have strong presence in India, will likely request slots at Navi Mumbai airport, she said. Adani Airport is in discussions with the “majority” of international airlines on how to expedite passenger flow, Bansal said, adding he expects 30% of the facility’s traffic to come from international flights and 70% from domestic. He didn’t specify if any airlines have committed to flying from the new facility. Transit TimeThe airport is being designed to reduce the transit time to catch connecting flights, ideally within 75 minutes in line with international norms, said Bansal. He also explained that each carrier will make its own business decision about which sectors to move to the new airport and which ones will stay at the older one. “You can’t force any airline to lift and shift,” he said. Adani Airport, which plans to list some time before 2028 and already runs seven other facilities, won’t “force any airlines to shut down from the older Mumbai airport and move to Navi Mumbai because that will be discriminatory, right?” he said. A Feb. 13 report from Jefferies estimated that more than half of Adani Airport’s forecast $1.7 billion revenue in 2026 will come from the two Mumbai facilities. Kawn, on the other hand, sees Adani’s ownership of the two airports as a boon considering there’ll be “no destructive competition.” The Navi Mumbai airport will also accentuate another major dilemma for local policymakers: whether to further open India’s skies. The South Asia nation is currently avoiding expanding the flying rights of foreign carriers to allow its own airlines — some of them financially vulnerable — to grow on international routes. But that policy choice risks hampering its own ambitions to become a global transit hub. ‘Tightrope’“India’s aviation strategy is walking a tightrope between liberalization and protectionism,” said John Grant, chief analyst at the UK-based OAG, a global travel data provider. “It’s hard to develop a world class hub if you don’t liberalize the market.” Dubai is “the best example where it takes time, investment and a very liberalized market to make that happen,” Grant said. Emirates and Qatar Airways have already built a business model ferrying Indians to the US and Europe via Dubai and Doha, taking advantage of Indian carriers’ fewer flights in international skies. By contrast, just 13% of the seat capacity offered by Air India, Vistara, IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd. is for international flights, according to Kwan. Another problem is that the existing Mumbai airport, despite having two runways, can only operate one at a time due to their intersecting alignment. That’s making it harder to keep up with India’s ballooning air traffic. Flights to Mumbai frequently get delayed due to air space congestion, forcing jets to hover over the city for as long as 60 minutes, the Ministry of Civil Aviation said last month. Navi Mumbai will have two parallel runways and four terminals, double the existing facility. Its success is also key to the city’s overall revamp. With a population of 21 million and growing rapidly, Mumbai has as much as $30 billion of new infrastructure being planned over the next few years. Local authorities, as well as the Adani Group, also have plans for an “aero city” around the new airport to boost non-aviation sources of revenue. Jefferies said in an October 2022 report that the conglomerate plans to create these “aero cities” around its airports in India via “a mix of hotels, convention centers, retail, entertainment and health care options, logistics and commercial offices.” The civil bodies overseeing the greater Mumbai metropolitan region are also building new bridges and roads between the island city and the mainland to provide critical connectivity to the new airport. A dedicated metro line between the two airports is also being planned. The aim is to reduce the commute to less than 45 minutes, according to a person familiar with the plans, who asked not to be identified as this person is not the official spokesperson. A six-lane bridge connecting Thane, another satellite city to the north of Mumbai, with Navi Mumbai may open by September, while two coastal roads will be done in the next few years, the person said. The good news is that all this supply of infrastructure should easily find demand. Load FactorsIndia’s capital, New Delhi, is also building its second commercial airport in the satellite city of Noida to cater to 12 million travelers annually when it starts at the end of this year. The city’s existing facility is also being upgraded to serve 100 million fliers, up from the current 70 million. The load factors of flights going from India to Europe and Africa exceeded 75% last year, driven by connecting passengers, according to Kwan. That means domestic carriers will be able to serve connecting traffic between the East and West. India is “strategically situated at the crossroads of major global routes,” she said. These new airports “could provide the blank canvas to grow India’s aviation hub ambitions.”",

    "content": "Alphabet Inc-owned Google has joined hands with Election Commission of India (ECI) to prevent spread of false information, promote authorised content and label AI-generated data during the upcoming general elections. Google India in a blog post on Tuesday said its product features are designed to elevate authoritative information on various election-related topics. \"We are collaborating with ECI to enable people to easily discover critical voting information on Google Search - such as how to register and how to vote - in both English and Hindi,\" Google said. \"As more advertisers leverage the power and opportunity of AI, we want to make sure we continue to provide people with greater transparency and the information they need to make informed decisions. Our ads policies already prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, like deepfakes or doctored content,\" it said. Google has already started displaying labels for content created with YouTube generative AI features, like Dream Screen. \"Soon, YouTube will begin to require creators to disclose when they've created realistic altered or synthetic content, and will display a label that indicates for people when they're watching this content,\" it said. The blog post further said the company has begun to roll out restrictions on the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses. It said that for news and information related to the election, YouTube's recommendation system prominently surfaces content from authoritative sources on the YouTube homepage, in search results, and highlights high-quality content from authoritative news sources. The popular search engine said they have set policies around demonstrably false claims in areas like manipulated content, incitement to violence, hate speech, and harassment, that could undermine democratic processes. \"We rely on a combination of human reviewers and machine learning to identify and remove content that violates our policies. Our AI models are enhancing our abuse-fighting efforts, while a dedicated team of local experts across all major Indian languages are working 24X7 to provide relevant context,\" the blog post said. Google has set strict policies and restrictions around who can run election-related advertising on its platforms. These include identity verification, certification and authorisation by the ECI, and financier disclosures. \"We take our responsibility for providing high-quality information for these types of queries seriously, and are continuously working to improve our protections,\" the blog post said. Google said it has recently joined the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), and pledged to help prevent deceptive AI-generated imagery, audio or video content from interfering with this year's global elections. Earlier, Google had introduced the Google News Initiative Training Network and the Fact Check Explorer tool to enable newsrooms and journalists deliver reliable, fact-checked updates to debunk misinformation. Additionally, Google is supporting Shakti, India Election Fact-Checking Collective, which is a consortium of news publishers and fact-checkers in India working together to aid the early detection of online misinformation, including deepfakes, and to create a common repository that news publishers can use to tackle the challenges of misinformation at scale. \"Google is committed to working with government, industry, and civil society and surface and connect voters to authoritative and helpful information online,\" the blog post said.",

    "description": "PM Modi, who visited Gujarat on Tuesday, inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of Rs 85,000 crore railway projects, including the launch of 10 new Vande Bharat trains, from Sabarmati area of Ahmedabad in Gujarat after visiting the Dedicated Freight Corridor's (DFC) Operation Control Centre here.The project has been developed under the Centre's PM Gati Shakti mission in partnership with the Gujarat government, Indian Railways and MSIL at a cost of Rs 976 crore, MSIL's Executive Officer, Corporate Affairs, Rahul Bharti said.Related stories",
    "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday inaugurated India's first automobile in-plant railway siding project of Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) at its plant at Hansalpur in Gujarat's Mehsana district virtually from a function here. PM Modi, who visited Gujarat on Tuesday, inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of Rs 85,000 crore railway projects, including the launch of 10 new Vande Bharat trains, from Sabarmati area of Ahmedabad in Gujarat after visiting the Dedicated Freight Corridor's (DFC) Operation Control Centre here. The MSIL's in-plant railway siding project was also inaugurated during the event. \"It is for the first time in India that an in-plant railway siding for any automobile company has happened. This is the excellence of the Gati Shakti programme,\" Bharti told media persons here. The project has been developed by a special purpose vehicle - Bahucharaji Rail Corporation Limited (BRCL) - set up with Gujarat Railway Infrastructure Development Corporation (GRIDE), Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) and MSIL as partners with 49 per cent, 29 per cent and 26 per cent equities each respectively. GRIDE is a joint venture between the Gujarat government and the Ministry of Railways. The railway line within the Bahucharaji plant is developed entirely by Maruti Suzuki at a cost of Rs 105 crore, Bharti said. The project eliminates an annual 50,000 truck trips for MSIL, with the automobile major planning to increase dispatches of finished cars by railway from 26 per cent currently to 40 per cent annually at its full capacity, he said. \"The project will save 50,000 truck trips, 35 million litres of fuel used in trucks per annum, and cut down on 1,650 tonnes per annum carbon emission. Logistics can be a good way of reducing our carbon emission, moving us towards carbon neutrality,\" Bharti said. \"Converting the dispatch from road to rail will benefit everyone as it reduces road congestion. A truck does an average trip of 1,600 km, and one train replaces 40 such trucks. One route of the train thereby helps us effectively eliminate 64,000 km of a truck running on the road,\" he said. The railway sliding has a capacity to dispatch 3,00,000 cars per annum with a present parking capacity of 800 cars expandable up to 3,000 cars, he said. Till February, Maruti Suzuki has dispatched around 18 lakh cars by railways. During the current fiscal till February, 4.09 lakh cars have been dispatched by the railways, he said. \"Our penetration of the railway as a mode of dispatch is the highest among all car manufacturers in the country. We have done more than 21 per cent of dispatches this year, and we want to keep increasing it further, the company's executive officer said. \"We want to keep increasing the share of railways in our finished goods dispatched from the factory to either the dealers in India or to ship for exports. Our exports are also growing, and the company now exports 42 per cent of cars from India. It will increase drastically in the future,\" he said. Giving details of the timeline of the project, Bharti said that G-RIDE gave its formal approval in March 2017, after which the company's internal board approved it in January 2019, and construction began in May 2020.",

    "description": "The firm's refinery at Paradip in Odisha will in three months produce the petrol used in F1 car racing, its chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said.IndianOil set to join high table of F1 fuel producersRelated stories",
    "content": "After delivering back-to-back innovations in fuel grades, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has now set sight on the Grand Prix and will in next three months start producing fuel used in adrenaline-pumping Formula One or F1, motor racing. The firm's refinery at Paradip in Odisha will in three months produce the petrol used in F1 car racing, its chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said. IOC, the country's largest oil firm controlling roughly 40 per cent of fuel market share, will be the first Indian company and only a handful globally that will produce fuel used in F1 racing. F1 fuel is essentially high-octane petrol and the standards are heavily regulated by global motor sport governing body Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) on various counts, including permissible additives and blending agents. IOC had in October last year helped India join a select league of nations when it began producing highly specialised 'reference' petrol and diesel that are used for testing automobiles. There are only three suppliers of reference fuels globally including US giant Chevron. IOC's Paradip refinery in Odisha is producing 'reference' grade petrol and its Panipat unit in Haryana produces similar quality diesel. Prior to this, Indian automobile manufacturers had to use imported reference fuel for testing cars and motorcycles. Now, IOC is supplying them the same grade fuel at much cheaper cost. Fuel retailers like IOC sell petrol and diesel of primarily two kinds - regular and premium, through their fuel station network. The biggest difference between the normal and premium fuel lies in the octane number. The regular fuel has an octane number of 87, but premium fuel has an octane number of 91. Reference grade fuel comes with a 97 octane number. The octane number is nothing but a unit to measure the ignition quality of petrol or diesel. Vaidya said his company has three premium fuels - 95-Octane XP95 petrol and 100-Octane XP100 petrol used in high-end luxury cars and bikes. It also has high performance XtraGreen diesel that offers higher fuel economy, reduced noise and emits lesser particulate matter, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. \"XtraGreen diesel is a real game changer fuel. It is catching up fast and now makes up for about 8 per cent of all diesel that IOC sells,\" he said.He said IOC has entered the racing fuels segment with its high-octane 'Storm' petrol for motorcycle racing. The company will be the official fuel partner for the Federation Internationale De Motocyclisme (FIM) Asia Road Racing Championship (ARRC) for three years -- 2024 to 2026, supplying 'Storm' petrol across all ARRC race rounds. IOC will supply fuel for all the motorcyclists from 15 countries that will participate in the FIM Asia Road Racing Championship. \"Our R\u0026D (research and development) in two months will be able to produce Category-1 fuel and in three months Formula 1 fuel,\" he said. \"Unless we go to F1, the journey is not complete.\" He said the 'Storm' fuel is being manufactured at the company's Koyali refinery in Gujarat. IOC makes XP100 at its Mathura refinery in Uttar Pradesh. F1 currently uses E10 fuel containing 10 per cent renewable ethanol. The percentage fuel coming from non-fossil sources, such as alcohol, algae or waste keeping, is to go up to 40 per cent this year and 100 per cent sustainable fuel from 2026. IOC would also start manufacturing similar grade fuel and thereafter pitch to automobile makers racing in F1, he said. Unlike FIM Asia Road Racing Championship where there is one single fuel supplier for all the motorcycles racing, F1 allows teams to select their own fuel supplier. For instance, Shell is the fuel supplier to Ferrari. \"This is just the beginning,\" Vaidya said. 'Storm - Ultimate Racing Fuel' provides faster acceleration, more power, smoother drivability, lower engine deposits and lower exhaust emissions. It is suitable for use in all racing championships (enduro, trial, circuit racing, motocross and supermoto, cross-country, e-bike, and track racing) in all classes of motorbikes requiring FIM Category 2 race fuels. F1 fuel will be a notch higher. It would fall under high octane premium road fuel with octane thresholds of 95 to 102.",

    "content": "The fast-moving consumer goods sector will have a \"subdued\" growth till September quarter in 2024 due to factors including an uncertain outlook for the agricultural sector, said a report from data, insights, and consulting firm Kantar. The agricultural sector has uncertainty and the upcoming general elections would not surge the consumption of FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) products, according to Kantar Worldpanel's FMCG pulse report. But it expects growth to get \"progressively\" better after September, and the year might yet turn good, especially in the second half, helped by good Rabi harvests. \"As a result, we do see FMCG growth to be subdued, at least until Q3 of 2024. Keeping in mind the stronger first half of 2023, we may even end up seeing some stagnation in the early part of the year, with things getting progressively better,\" it said. Over the general election, which is supposed to be in the June quarter of 2024, the report said the past election years did not see any surge in FMCG. \"On the contrary with all the freebies announced there was only stagnation or shrinkage,\" it said. In 2009 the consumption growth was 0.7 per cent, in 2014 it was static and in 2019 it was negative, it added. \"While the voter, and therefore the consumer has evolved from then to now, we really do not see FMCG at the national level being impacted significantly due to the general elections,\" it said. Regarding the agricultural growth of India, the report said it is projected to be at 1.8 per cent in 2023-24, which is a seven-year low. \"As per the first estimates of Kharif crops released, almost all Kharif crops have seen lower yields due to uneven rainfall. This is likely to impact the first half of 2024,\" said the report. However, the Rabi sowing, though mildly disturbed is much better, with record hectarage under the wheat crop, the year might yet turn good, especially in the second half. Over the year 2023, the report said after the pandemic, this is the second straight year where average purchase quantity has failed to grow. Out of the over 90 categories and subcategories, which it tracked, half of them \"either lost consumption or were static\". The biggest such average consumption drop was seen for cooking oils, where 1.4 fewer litres were purchased in 2023, compared to 2022, while the average spend on the category has gone up by Rs 95. \"In reality, if shoppers were purchasing the 2022 quantity with 2023 prices, they would have been spending Rs 286 extra, however, the drop in consumption of the category has reduced this extra spend to the aforementioned Rs 95,\" it said. Atta has continued to grow in double digits, throughout 2023, and as a result though FMCG seemed to have grown at a handsome 6.1 per cent in 2023, it said. \"Removing Atta from the mix brought the growth down to 2.7 per cent. Incidentally, 2.7 per cent is also the population growth in the year, which meant that FMCG volumes have grown purely on the basis of household population growth,\" the report said.",

The New York-based media company has been in advanced talks to sell its minority stake in Viacom18 Media Pvt. to Reliance, said the people, who asked to not to be identified as the information is private. Talks between Paramount and Reliance are still ongoing and may not result in a deal, the people said. Representatives for Paramount, Viacom18 and Reliance all declined to comment. Bloomberg Intelligence estimated a sale of the Viacom18 position could generate as much as $550 million that Paramount could use toward debt reduction. Paramount shares rose 3.4% to $10.56 as of 12:30 p.m. in New York Viacom18 has spearheaded Reliance Group’s media foray in recent years as billionaire Ambani steadily shifted his fossil fuels-led conglomerate toward consumer-facing and technology-led businesses. Viacom18 was also the vehicle through which Reliance outbid Walt Disney Co. in 2022 to win the coveted streaming rights of the Indian Premier League, or IPL, cricket tournament. Disney and Reliance signed a binding agreement last month to merge their Indian media operations, in mounting evidence that global giants were ceding ground to local heavyweights. Reliance and its associates will have a 63% stake in the new $8.5 billion media powerhouse, with Disney holding the rest. Paramount’s stake, via Viacom18, will also shrink with the new deal. Disney’s decision to merge with Reliance followed its struggle to retain subscribers. Ambani’s conglomerate disrupted the sports broadcast segment by streaming IPL cricket games for free in the cricket-crazy nation of over 1.4 billion people. Viacom18 signed a multiyear pact to distribute programming from Warner Bros Discovery Inc., in another recent setback to Disney in India. Sony Group Corp., which has also fought to grow its market share in India, suffered a big blow after its merger with Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. collapsed following long-lasting disagreements with Zee founders. Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.",

    "content": "Siemens is \"very positive\" about its prospects in India, managing board member Matthias Rebellius said, as the country's economy booms and offers the chance to diversify from China. Rebellius, head of Siemens' Smart Infrastructure business, said India was a priority for future investments as it upgrades its electric grid and invests in renewable energy. \"We are very positive on India, and it is one of our main growth markets,\" Rebellius told Reuters in an interview. India's economy is on the up, with Moody's raising its growth forecast on Monday. In contrast, Chinese growth is slowing as the property sector and external demand weigh. In addition to transportation in India, the German engineering group also sees opportunities in grid upgrades and electrification components for solar projects, Rebellius said. Siemens' Indian subsidiary, Siemens Ltd, increased sales by 18% to 179.7 billion Indian rupees ($2.17 billion) last year, according its annual report. The unit, which includes the assets of Siemens Energy but not the Siemens Healthineers business, is now 69% Siemens-owned after it recently increased its stake. Siemens rival ABB last year said it was seeing some customers shift investments from China to India and other parts of Asia due to geopolitical tensions. Although India would not replace China, Siemens's third-biggest market, it would become the focus of more investments, Rebellius said. Globally, the executive said Smart Infrastructure, which produces products to control buildings, was seeing a return to normal ordering patterns since the COVID pandemic. \"The destocking trend seems to be over,\" he said. Siemens this week also launched a sustainability label called \"Siemens EcoTech\", which provides information on the materials used, production, design and lifecycle, a tag Rebellius said customers increasingly wanted. Among the products carrying the label are a new electronic circuit protection device. \"This helps us to increase sales and keep prices stable,\" he said.",

    "description": "The value of Paytm payments made on India’s state-backed transactions system fell 14% to 1.65 trillion rupees ($19.9 billion) from January, the National Payments Council of India said on its website Wednesday.Google, Walmart gain India fintech users after paytm curbsRelated stories",
    "content": "Google and Walmart Inc. are rapidly gaining customers from India’s Paytm, the fintech pioneer struggling to navigate central bank restrictions and the potential shutdown of a key payments affiliate. The value of Paytm payments made on India’s state-backed transactions system fell 14% to 1.65 trillion rupees ($19.9 billion) from January, the National Payments Council of India said on its website Wednesday. Walmart-owned PhonePe and Google’s GPay, which both process far more payments than No. 3 Paytm, each had an increase in their payments value. Paytm’s decline suggests consumers are moving usage to alternative services even before any disruption to its systems. The new curbs affecting Paytm are kicking in on March 15, and even after that the company expects its digital payments services to keep running as before. Yet the firm’s stock has slumped since the regulator unveiled its action in late January, on concern the restrictions will crimp the fintech pioneer’s prospects. Companies don’t make any money on transactions on the state-backed system, called Unified Payments Interface, but it provides them with a massive catchment of hundreds of millions of consumers to whom they can cross-sell services such as insurance and mutual funds. The Reserve Bank of India on Jan. 31 ordered Paytm Payments Bank — which isn’t controlled by Paytm but which processes much of its payments and financial services — to halt much of its business. Though Paytm has quickly pulled together other bank partnerships to stay in business, the regulator’s move triggered a sharp slide in its stock and hit customer sentiment. Shares in Paytm are dow almost 50% since late January. In his first public comments after the RBI action, Paytm’s billionaire founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma this week voiced confidence that his digital payments company will overcome the regulatory setbacks and stage a comeback as a stronger company. Both Paytm Payments Bank and Paytm, which is traded as One97 Communications Ltd., are part of Sharma’s fintech empire but the bank isn’t listed. Sharma owns 51% of the bank, with One97 holding the remainder. PhonePe and GPay have typically been far ahead of Paytm in UPI transactions by value and volume even before Paytm’s affiliate bank was hit by the curbs.",

    "content": "The digital media will potentially overtake television as the leading segment in the media \u0026 entertainment sector in 2024 with an estimated size of Rs 75,100 crore, said a joint report from industry body FICCI (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry) and EY on Tuesday. While the Indian Media \u0026 Entertainment (M\u0026E) sector grew by 8.1 per cent in 2023, reaching Rs 2.32 lakh crore and is expected to touch Rs 2.55 lakh crore and cross Rs 3 lakh crore mark by 2026, it added. \"We expect the M\u0026E sector to grow 10.2 per cent to reach Rs 2.55 trillion by 2024, then grow at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 10 per cent to reach Rs 3.08 trillion by 2026,\" the report said. The report estimates digital media would be around Rs 95,500 crore in 2026, with a CAGR growth of 13.5 per cent between 2023-26. While TV media would be Rs 76,600 crore, which would be around 20 per cent less than digital media. \"In 2024, digital media is poised for explosive growth, potentially overtaking television to become the leading segment of the M\u0026E sector. This surge in digital media is forecasted to propel the M\u0026E sector's growth to a 10 per cent annual rate, crossing Rs 3 trillion (USD 37.1 billion) by 2026,\" said Kevin Vaz Chairman, FICCI Media and Entertainment Committee. This growth is buoyed by a robust digital infrastructure, widespread adoption of OTT platforms, significant growth in the gaming segment, and the availability of cost-effective options for consumers. The report expects digital advertising to grow at a 13.5 per cent CAGR to reach Rs 84,200 crore, on the back of improved governance. According to the report, the connected TV (smart TV) saw a 50 per cent growth as internet penetration continues to rise. \"The broadband market is growing with subscription numbers recording 904 million. It is inevitable that smartphone users have grown and consequently, the average usage time continues to rise,\" it said. However, it also added despite high app downloads of 26.4 billion, India was behind in monetising this potential, with users spending half their time on social media apps. \"The year also saw the growth of digital ad spending by 15 per cent, predominantly in search and social media. By 2026, the digital segment is expected to grow to Rs 95,000 crore with an increased focus on governance,\" it said. The Media \u0026 Entertainment sector (M\u0026E) sector, which was around Rs 2.14 lakh crore has grown around Rs 17,300 crore in 2023, led by growth from Digital media, Print, Online gaming, and Animation and VFX, the report said. \"While the sector was 21 per cent above its pre-pandemic levels, television, print, and radio still lagged their 2019 levels,\" it said. The share of traditional media, which includes television, print, filmed entertainment, live events, OOH (Out-of-home), music, and radio stood at 57 per cent of M\u0026E sector revenues in 2023, down from 76 per cent in 2019, it added. In 2023, TV advertising fell 6.5 per cent due to a slowdown in spending by gaming and D2C brands, which impacted revenues for premium properties. On the print media, the report said it has buckled the global trend and continued to thrive in India. \"Advertising revenues grew 4 per cent in 2023, with a notable growth in premium ad formats, as print remained a \"go-to\" medium for more affluent and nonmetro audiences. Subscription revenues grew 3 per cent on the back of rising cover prices. Digital revenues were insignificant for most print companies,\" it said.",

    "content": "German carmaker Mercedes-Benz expects India to become its third biggest market in its 'Region Overseas' over the next 2-3 years with demand anticipated to remain strong for luxury products, according to a senior company executive. The Region Overseas for Mercedes Benz comprises 118 countries, excluding North America, Europe and China. India is the fifth largest market in the region after Japan, South Korea, Australia and Turkey. \"Our Region Overseas markets which encompass 118 markets across the world and India happens to be market number five for us. So you can imagine the relevance and importance it serves not only today, but also for the future of the Mercedes Benz brand,\" Mercedes-Benz AG Head of Region Overseas, Sagree Sardien told reporters here. When asked about the expected timeframe to achieve the target, she stated, \"We are convinced that with the way the Indian market is developing, we should see this happening in the next two to three years.\" Terming India a strategic market for the brand, Sardien noted that the company has seen sales of its high-end models grow in double digits for the last couple of years and expects the same to continue this year and beyond. She noted that the company will add 12 new models, including three battery electric vehicles, in the market this year. The company also plans to tap smaller cities as it looks to establish sales outlets in 10 new locations ranging from Jammu to Kottayam to scale operations, Sardien stated. Mercedes-Benz India reported its highest ever sales of 17,408 units in 2023. Sardien said the electrification journey in India is picking up slowly for Mercedes-Benz with 4 per cent of total sales in the country coming from EVs. \"I completely believe that we will see a double-digit (growth) in electrification for our product range within this market,\" she said. \"Customers' preferences are obviously at a much slower pace than the demand we expected,\" she said adding the company would go according to the transformation of customers. Sardien noted that the company will not change its strategic direction. \"It is clear that the future is electric for us, but we ensure that we cater for our customers' changing preferences and where market conditions are actually allowing,\" she said. When asked about the potential of the overall luxury car market in India, Sardien said it can touch 1 lakh unit mark probably by the end of this decade. \"But I think there are some fundamental things that need to happen in the market and it is highly dependent on how customers transition here between the combustion engine and the battery electric vehicle architecture,\" she added. The luxury car market in India is around 47,000 units per annum and remains a miniscule part of the overall passenger vehicle segment which crossed the 41 lakh units mark last year.",

This renewed three-year agreement with Union Bank of India (UBI) includes both residential and Commercial and Industrial (C\u0026I) segments compared to the earlier one which focused only on the C\u0026I segment. The loan tenure has also been extended up to 10 years, allowing households and businesses ample time for repayment, it said.

Tata Power Solar Systems Ltd is a subsidiary of TPREL.

    "content": "Tata Sons Ltd. may fetch a valuation of as much as 8 trillion rupees ($96 billion) in an initial public offering that could potentially take place within the next 18 months, according to Mumbai-based investment banking firm Spark PWM Pvt. The Indian conglomerate — which owns stakes in software major Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Jaguar Land Rover maker Tata Motors Ltd. — was classified as an “upper-layer” non-banking financial company by the central bank in September 2022. The category, among other requirements, mandates that such firms seek a public listing within a period of three years. “There are multiple levers of value available from the unlisted investments as the group is entering into new age segments such as semi-conductors” and EV batteries, which could deliver significantly higher value over time, analyst Vidit Shah wrote in a note dated March 4. The listing of Tata Sons would give a boost to India’s IPO market, which has seen a slew of companies looking to sell shares as valuations boom. Listings in the South Asian country has been active, with debuts more than doubling to 56 since the start of 2024 compared to the same period last year. The market value of Tata Sons’ listed investments is estimated at 16 trillion rupees, while its privately-held stakes are projected to be worth about 1-2 trillion rupees, Shah said. Investors may bake in a discount of 30-60% for the holding company, he added. Based on a peak valuation of $96 billion, even a 5% stake in the company would still be worth more than Life Insurance Corp of India’s $2.7 billion IPO in 2022. An IPO may also “lead to the simplification of the complicated group holding structure of the Tata Group,” and may see some of the listed firms liquidate their holdings within the salt-to-software conglomerate, according to Shah. “We believe that ~80% of Tata Sons’ holdings might not be monetizable but the process of restructuring could trigger a re-rating,” Shah said.",

    "description": "Demand for longer-tenor papers has risen due to increased purchases by pension funds and insurers. A $50 billion India pension fund may turn to corporate bondsRelated stories",
    "content": "The narrowing spreads on longer-maturity Indian government bonds may prompt SBI Pension Funds Pvt. to look for opportunities in corporate and state debt, according to its chief investment officer. “We expect some term premium for the longer-dated securities and if that spread is not available, it would impact the accruals for my subscribers,” Sandeep Pandey, who manages 4.2 trillion rupees ($50 billion) in assets, said in an interview. “I’ll probably have to evaluate other avenues, including state debt or corporate bonds.” Demand for longer-tenor papers has risen due to increased purchases by pension funds and insurers. This has compressed the spread between the 10-year and 30-year bonds to six basis points from more than 100 basis points in May 2020, diminishing the incentive for investors seeking higher yields for holding debt for longer. The yields on benchmark 10-year bond has declined by more than 30 basis points since October to 7.06% on Tuesday, as global funds added to their holdings of index-eligible bonds ahead of the nation’s upcoming inclusion in global bond indexes. In comparison, the yields on top-rated similar-maturity corporate bond stands at 7.54%. The tight liquidity situation in the banking system is also helping widen spreads on the corporate bond portfolio, while the fund doesn’t have much presence on the shorter-end in the government bond curve, Pandey said. Pension funds, insurance companies and provident funds typically see around 15% to 20% incremental flows, while the net supply of sovereign paper hasn’t changed for the coming fiscal year, helping boost demand, said Pandey. The fund has about a one-trillion-rupees portfolio in corporate paper, while about 2.5 trillion rupees in sovereign and state debt. SBI Pension has been positioning for a rate cut by extending the ‘modified duration’ in its bond portfolio to around 6.8-to-6.9 years from 6 years over the past eighteen months, Pandey said. The central bank may cut interest rates by September with a shallow rate cut cycle of around 50 basis points, Pandey said. With the historic spread between the repo rate and 10-year yield being around 50-60 basis points, the 10-year yield should have a floor around 6.75%, he said.",

    "content": "Adani group saw massive demand on Monday for its first dollar bond since a short-seller attack last year, in what two banking sources said was being seen internally as a test for the conglomerate's access to global capital markets. Adani Green Energy priced a $409 million 18-year bond after receiving nearly $3 billion of demand for it, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the deal. The issuer received bids from 163 investors, of which, 45% were from Asia, 24% from the United States, 21% from Europe and the rest from the Middle East, a company source told Reuters on Tuesday, requesting anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The final coupon pricing was sharply below the fair value seen by CreditSights at 7.45% and also lower than Nomura's 6.8250%. Analysts at CreditSights had noted that the bonds were likely to generate strong demand given the lack of high-yield paper in the Asian U.S. dollar bond market and the enthusiasm for Indian renewable infrastructure credit. Nomura did not factor in any new issuer premium on Adani Green's bond issue considering the muted supply of Asian high yield bonds and the stronger than expected bond performance of the latest bond offering by IRB Infrastructure Developers, it said in a note. Other operating companies in the group could follow with bond issues after seeing robust demand, the first source said. Adani Energy Solutions is planning to raise around $400 million-$500 million through a private placement of bonds for which it is in early talks with U.S. institutional investors, Reuters reported last week. The board of Adani Green Energy has approved the above-mentioned pricing, tenure and the other terms of the bond issue, it informed Indian exchanges on Tuesday. Adani group company stocks and bonds saw a massive selloff early last year after U.S. short seller Hindenburg Research issued a report that alleged improper governance practices, stock manipulation and use of tax havens by the Adani Group. The group has denied these allegations. In the aftermath of the selloff Adani executives and advisers launched a charm offensive with investors globally, according to the bankers. The proceeds from the bond issue will be used by the company to repay $500 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in June. The bonds are rated 'Ba1' by Moody's Investor Service and 'BBB-' by Fitch Ratings.",

    "description": "As investigations go on, political parties trade charges. The BJP has alleged that the Congress is turning the IT capital into ‘Bomb Bengaluru’, while the Karnataka Deputy CM, D K Shivakumar has accused the opposition of tarnishing the tech capital’s image.The accused used an IED with a one-hour timer and the blast took place in popular Rameshwaram Cafe at 12:55 pm during lunch hoursRelated stories",
    "content": "The location of the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blast in Bengaluru on March 1 may have well been a carefully chosen target. Kundalahalli in East Bengaluru is one of the tech nerve centres of the IT capital. Tech parks such as Prestige Technostar, Sattva Knowledge Court, Brigade Tech Gardens, Bagmane Solarium City, and RMZ NXT complex, and firms such as SAP Labs, NTT Data, GE Healthcare, Capgemini, Qualcomm, WNS, and IFB Industries Limited have their offices in the vicinity. As many as 10 people were injured in the blast. The accused used an IED with a one-hour timer and the blast took place in Rameshwaram Cafe at 12:55 pm during lunch hour. Weekday lunch customers are largely office goers, particularly IT professionals working in neighbouring tech parks. \"It’s very likely the accused did a recce of the place before the actual operation. It ticked many boxes – primarily it being a high footfall area and IT hub so it was certain to grab the intended eyeballs,\" a senior police official told Moneycontrol. Police are looking into the motive behind the blast – whether it’s a terror act or was caused by business rivalry. “It’s a pre-planned act from the looks of it. The accused would've carried out a recce and if you look at the CCTV footage, he has taken precautions to avoid identification by wearing a cap, glasses, and mask. He travelled by bus (instead of a private vehicle), and paid for Rava idli with cash. A final picture will emerge only once the investigation is completed,\" he said. Also, read: Rameshwaram cafe blast: CCTV footage shows suspect ordering idli before walking away State home minister G Parameshwara told reporters that bolts and nails (splinters/shrapnel) exploded vertically for some reason. It could have been more serious if they had exploded horizontally. Karnataka Deputy CM DK Shivakumar, Home Minister G Parameshwara, and Bengaluru City Police Commissioner B Dayananda are in discussion. Parameshwara said police are analysing footage from 40-50 CCTV cameras as well as 26 buses that passed through the road during that period. Police are also investigating whether the accused took multiple buses and changed attire to evade detection. S T Ramesh, former DGP and IGP of Karnataka police, told Moneycontrol:  \"In this case, the accused seems to have taken a series of safety measures to conceal his identity. But there is no such thing as a perfect crime. Given the tools made available by technology today —CCTV, mobile tower, call analysis, and other forensic tools—it's always possible to trace the accused\". Impact on Brand Bengaluru This incident took place on a day when global names, the likes of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Ivanka Trump, were in India. Union Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Rajeev Chandrasekhar told Moneycontrol: “Bengaluru is an important city and centre for our digital economy.  A lot of our Prime Minister's vision for the country's ambitions around innovation and the digital economy rests in Bengaluru. So, the law and order in Bengaluru and safety of people is certainly a matter of concern.\" Chandrasekhar said: “Bengaluru's reputation as a safe city for investors, expats, and people from around the country who come and work there must not be allowed to be impacted even by a percentage. It must be investigated and the police should be given a free hand to investigate it and bring the people to book\" he said. Karnataka, the hub for major tech firms, contributes  42 percent of India's IT exports. With over 5,500 IT/ITeS companies and around 750 MNCs, it provides direct employment to over 12 lakh professionals and generates over 31 lakh indirect jobs. The state boasts a significant presence in various sectors, including hosting 40 unicorns, 440 GCCs, and 14,000 start-ups, as per state government records. In addition to IT/ITeS, Karnataka holds a substantial position in electronics design (40 percent share), machine tools manufacturing (52 percent), aerospace \u0026 defence manufacturing (65 percent), and biotechnology exports (60 percent). In 2009, Infosys became the first private company in India to get CISF cover for its campus in Electronics City after the 2008 Mumbai attacks.  Later, its Mysuru campus was also covered. In 2010, CISF cover was extended to other companies such as Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Siemens, Hewlett Packard, and Tata Consultancy Services after the Electronics City Industrial Township Authority, which maintains the industrial estate, agreed to bear the expenditure of the CISF deployment. Political slugfest over Brand Bengaluru Taking a swipe at Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar's pet 'Brand Bengaluru' campaign aimed at drawing global investors to the city, BJP on Sunday alleged that Congress has turned the tech capital into ‘Bomb Bengaluru’. BJP posted a poster on X (formerly Twitter) which read, \"They said 'Brand Bengaluru'. They made it 'Bomb Bengaluru'.\" Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya was the first among the leaders to state that it was a bomb blast. At 3:35 pm on March 1, he wrote on X : \"Just spoke to Rameshwaram Cafe founder Sri Nagaraj about the blast in his restaurant. He informed me that the blast occurred because of a bag that was left by a customer and not any cylinder explosion”. Responding to BJP’s charges, Shivakumar said: “BJP is exploiting the opportunity to gain political mileage. They are tarnishing the image of Bengaluru and Karnataka in the process. They may have forgotten things that happened during their term. I don't want to engage in politics over it, but they should introspect. At times like these, they should be aware of the nation's unity, integrity, and peace.” Parameshwara said: \"Police are also investigating various strands including whether it is a business rivalry, or an act carried out given the impending Lok Sabha polls as well as to scare off investors. We have a stable government in the state so there might be elements who want Bengaluru to appear unsafe.” Need to step up safety measures Experts and citizens urge the government to step up security, especially on tech corridors. Revathy Ashok, CEO of the Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.PAC),  an NGO said, \"This is a wake-up call for all of us in the city. The government should conduct extensive combing operations to get to the bottom of this. There is enough technology to support this\". She said Intelligence agencies constantly receive a lot of information from multiple sources. \"In many instances, while there might have been some clues that all is not well, the failure to connect the dots and prevent an unfortunate incident is sometimes the key problem. Being a high-profile city with significant global linkages, our Intelligence agencies must be on red alert and act with speed and alacrity. Constant communication with citizens to reassure them of safety measures being taken by the government is also critical.\" R K Misra, co-founder of Yulu Bikes, agrees, \"Safety and security are ongoing concerns and challenges. There is no foolproof method, but constant vigilance and robust Intelligence gathering by various agencies, along with efficient exchange of Intelligence among various state and national agencies, are of utmost importance.\" Ramesh said it's premature to call it an “Intelligence failure”. “It appears, so far, to be a one-man operation, but whether it was a lone wolf operation or if there were other people or group(s) or any organisation behind it, is being looked into.\" Also, read: First-person account: A 43-km Metro ride from Bengaluru's tech hub Whitefield for Rs 60 Some residents said the public should be more vigilant.  Pravir B, a Whitefield resident and frequent commuter to the Rameshwaram Cafe area where the blast happened, said, \"We all must stay vigilant in public spaces. Last Sunday, I alerted a young man who was leaving behind a large bag while alighting from the Metro. If we notice anything suspicious, we should immediately call the police.” Clement Jayakumar, Mahadevapura MLA Task Force member, suggested, \"There should be visible policing. Police officers in uniform should be deployed in crowded areas like markets, commercial areas, Metro, etc. Hoysala patrolling vehicles with flashing lights should be deployed in key areas, especially at night\". He said the government should install more cameras in outer zones as part of the Nirbhaya project. \"CCTV camera feeds from entrances of IT parks, malls, and high-footfall shops should be integrated to the command centre. Police should also create public awareness through frequent announcements by Hoysala vehicles.\" Hotel association to frame SOPs Bruhat Bangalore Hotels Association said they will come up with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to enhance the security system at hotels across the city. The blast also cast a shadow on the state government’s recent budget announcement to allow shops and business establishments in the city and 10 other corporations to operate till 1 am. Association president PC Rao said: \"We will soon call a stakeholder meeting and come up with an SOP to ensure the safety of restaurant owners, employees, and customers\".

    "content": "Serum Institute of India aims to significantly boost supply of its human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine as it gears up to provide its shots to the government at cheaper rates for an immunisation campaign this year against the cancer-causing virus. Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of the world's biggest vaccine maker by the number of doses, told Reuters that he expects the vaccine to be a part of the government's programme by year-end. The vaccine, currently available in the private market for 2,000 rupees ($24.13), is India's first indigenous shot against HPV that plays a role in causing most cervical cancers in the world. The government is set to administer the HPV vaccine to girls aged between nine and 14 years as part of a campaign to fight cervical cancer, the second-most common type of cancer in women in India. There is no contract yet with the government, Poonawalla said, adding that he expects the authorities to initially procure between 40 to 50 million doses through a tender process in December. Other HPV vaccine makers include Merck \u0026 Co and GSK Plc, who could also bid for government contracts. \"It's still a bit early to say but we're just poised and very committed to this product,\" he said. Poonawalla expects the vaccine to be \"substantially, probably eight times, cheaper\" when supplied to the government. Serum produces AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine under the brand name Covishield in India. The company's HPV facilities, which were used during the pandemic to manufacture Covishield are still not entirely operational, restraining full capacity, according to Serum. The company is in the process of applying for WHO's pre-qualification and Poonawalla expects to begin exporting the HPV shots to other countries in 2026.",

    "content": "India’s top airlines, Air India Ltd. and IndiGo, said their short-term expansion plans remain on track as they sidestep the lingering supply-chain snarls that have rattled the global aviation industry. Both carriers have bet big on a travel boom in India, laying out ambitious fleet expansion plans over the past year. In June, IndiGo placed a record-breaking order with Airbus SE for 500 narrowbody aircraft, to be delivered between 2030 and 2035. And Air India has 470 aircraft on order with Airbus and Boeing Co. But like airlines around the world, they’re now grappling with a series of supply chain headaches that risk further delaying aircraft deliveries, paring back flight schedules and hindering the industry’s post-Covid recovery. Top executives at the Indian carriers say they’re able to plug potential capacity gaps with a raft of measures including taking delivery of aircraft initially destined for other firms and even flying rivals’ jets. Some of the planes it has on order were produced for other carriers that were then unable to take delivery, he said. The airline will continue to add a new aircraft every six days into next year and it’s not until toward the end of 2025 that there may be some “production risk” for aircraft, Wilson said. IndiGo, which has a backlog of almost 1,000 single-aisle Airbus jets, is predicting it will take one new plane each week and is implementing measures to mitigate disruptions. “We have been able to live up to our capacity guidance,” IndiGo Chief Executive Officer Pieter Elbers said in an interview in Singapore. IndiGo is supplementing the supply of new jets with the extension of plane leases and using wet leases — the practice of leasing an aircraft, along with crew to fly the plane and provide service onboard, he said. IndiGo has around 70 aircraft grounded due to the ongoing issues with Pratt \u0026 Whitney GTF engines, Chief Financial Officer Gaurav Negi said earlier this month. The carrier is discussing compensation with the firm’s RTX Corp. unit, Elbers said.",

    "content": "Swedish premium car maker Volvo on Tuesday said it is expecting a faster adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the luxury car segment within the overall passenger vehicle division in the country. The company further said EVs may account for one-third of its total car sales in India this year. \"The EV penetration in the overall passenger vehicle segment is nothing, about 2 per cent, while in the luxury segment it is 7 per cent. So, adoption of EVs in the luxury segment will be faster,\" Volvo Car India Managing Director Jyoti Malhotra said. In 2023, Volvo Car India retailed 2,423 cars, while 690 of them were EVs. The company plans to introduce its two fully electric cars -- EX30 and EX90 -- in the domestic market next year. Volvo Car has said it is planning to be an all-electric vehicle company globally by 2030. \"I would say 2023 was a good year for us from an overall volume perspective with a growth of almost 31 per cent, which is good in the sense that we were the fastest within the Asia Pacific,\" Malhotra said. The more heartening thing is the growth that Volvo Car India saw in the adoption of EVs, he said. \"For us, we are selling more EVs and our ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) products are made to order. (As much as) 30-35 per cent of new customers are for electric cars,\" he said. The company is selling its EVs through online direct sales, and plans on selling its ICE and hybrid products also online. With the newly launched C40, the company has witnessed a younger customer profile. He also said the company is selling EVs directly to consumers but added that dealers also play a very important role. \"It is a different structure that we have with them,\" he added. On a recent fire incident in a Volvo electric car, he said though it is \"rare of the rarest\" incidents, an investigation is underway.",

    "content": "Kedaara Capital is set to raise $1.7 billion for what would be India's biggest-ever private equity fund, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said, highlighting huge interest in the country's fast-growing economy amid a shift away from China. The latest fund will be Kedaara's fourth and will be 54% larger than its previous one in 2021. The plans come as India's stock markets are trading at record highs. While there have only been a handful of significant India-specific PE funds to date, they are growing in size. Kedaara, founded in 2011 by former Temasek and General Atlantic executives, is one of India's best-known buyout funds. They declined to be identified as the discussions were private. Kedaara declined to comment. Cleveland Clinic and the University of Minnesota did not respond to queries seeking comment. The fund will likely invest in sectors such as banking, healthcare, consumer and software and it will seek both minority stakes and buyout deals, the sources said. Kedaara plans to announce the fund by the end of March and is currently finalising documentation with its investors, they added. According to one of the sources, investors were interested in committing more than $2 billion to the new fund, but Kedaara decided to cap it at around $1.7 billion so as not to strain their ability to deploy. Investors in Kedaara's previous funds include Canada's Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Singapore state investor Temasek and the International Finance Corporation, Pitchbook data shows. India has been benefiting from increased interest as Western firms look to diversify away from China amid heightened trade and economic tensions between Washington and Beijing. Last year, India's share of Asia-Pacific private equity deals grew to 23% while China's fell to a nine-year low of 31%, consultancy firm Bain said in a report. Kedaara's three previous funds raised a combined $2.4 billion between 2011 and 2021 which was invested in 27 Indian companies including SoftBank-backed eyewear-maker Lenskart and Mahindra Logistics. Kedaara has sold stakes in companies fairly regularly, generating good profits to return money to investors - a key performance metric, one of the sources said. Last year, Kedaara sold its remaining stake in Mahindra Logistics in the stock market for a total return of 3.5 times its investment.",

    "content": "U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly expects to launch Mounjaro, its blockbuster diabetes drug and wildly popular obesity treatment, in India as early as next year after it clears an ongoing regulatory review, CEO David Ricks told Reuters on Wednesday. The market opportunity is huge in the world's most populous country, which has high obesity rates, especially among women, and the second-highest number of people with type-2 diabetes globally. Indian drugmakers are testing their own versions of weight-loss drugs, while illegal versions are also sold online. \"Our famous Mounjaro – it's under review now. So, perhaps as early as next year to the Indian market,\" Ricks told Reuters on the sidelines of the BioAsia conference in the southern state of Telangana. Mounjaro, chemically known as tirzepatide, is currently sold in the UK and Europe under the same brand name for both conditions. However, it is sold under the brand name Zepbound for weight loss in the U.S. Mounjaro is being reviewed by Indian drug regulators, for which Lilly is using data from its global trials, which included some Indian participants, a company source said, declining to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media. Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound as well as Danish rival Novo Nordisk's in-demand Wegovy and Ozempic are therapies known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, developed to control blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes. But they also slow digestion, helping patients feel full longer, which has led to an explosion in their popularity and left Lilly and Novo Nordisk struggling to keep up with demand. The global market for these treatments is expected to reach at least $100 billion by the end of the decade, analysts estimate. Last year, a top Novo Nordisk official told Reuters the Danish company was aiming to bring Wegovy to India in 2026. Indian drugmakers, which are among the world's largest generic drug makers, are already developing their own versions of Wegovy. These companies include Zydus Lifesciences, Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy's and Lupin. Of them, Lupin and Cipla are Lilly's Indian distributors, including for some of its older diabetes treatments such as Eglucent, Aplevant, Basaglar and Trulicity. REGULATORY RIGMAROLE India should boost patent protection, get rid of redundant policies and create a social safety net to win more investment from global drugmakers, Ricks said in his keynote address at the BioAsia conference. These steps, he said, would help drive \"broader interests for multinationals and foreign direct investment\" in India's pharmaceutical industry. \"India has many specific policies related to its regulatory environment all set up for good reason. But in hindsight, perhaps we can reflect upon them and find redundant policies that only cause delay and extra cost.\" Ricks said these regulatory challenges had the \"two-way effect\" of making it tough for companies like Lilly to bring new medicines into the market and constraining local biotechs to export their inventions.",

Inflation excluding volatile items and holiday travel slowed to 4.1% from 4.2%. \"I think we want to be careful about reading too much into one month's figure, but there is nothing in here that won't be good news for the RBA,\" said Jonathan Kearns, chief economist at Challenger. \"The question really is going to be what's happening with services inflation,\" he added. February's figures will capture more price changes for a range of services from hair cuts to dining out. The Australian dollar reacted little to the data and was last 0.1% lower at $0.6538. Three-year bond futures held at 96.24. For January alone, CPI fell 0.3% from the previous month, driven by declines in holiday travel, clothes and garments and petrol. Holiday travel slumped 5.2% from a month earlier. Rents grew 7.4% in January from a year earlier, unchanged from December, a sign that rent inflation likely has peaked, while electricity prices rose a modest 0.8%, helped by the government's relief policy. \"The January data suggest that price pressures are likely to abate more rapidly than the RBA is expecting,\" said Marcel Thieliant, Capital Economics' Head of Asia Pacific, adding that he is confident with his call for a first rate cut in August. \"Barring any unforeseen shocks, it seems increasingly likely that the CPI data will undershoot both of the bank's projections.\" The Reserve Bank of Australia has raised interest rates by 425 basis points since May 2022 to a 12-year top of 4.35%, and has not ruled out the risk of another hike if necessary to bring inflation back to the bank's target band of 2-3%. Financial markets are confident the RBA is done tightening. Swaps imply about a 60% chance of a first rate cut in August and a total easing of 38 basis points by the end of the year, little changed from before.",

    "content": "Country Garden Holdings said on Wednesday a liquidation petition has been filed against the embattled developer for non-payment of a loan worth $205 million, adding to the woes for China's liquidity crisis-hit property sector. Country Garden said in a regulatory filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange it would \"resolutely\" oppose the petition, which was filed by a creditor, Ever Credit Limited, a unit of Kingboard Holdings. A court hearing had been set for May 17. Country Garden's shares fell more than 12% in early trade, lagging a 0.2% gain for the benchmark Hang Seng Index. It comes a month after China Evergrande Group, the world's most indebted property developer with $300 billion in liabilities, was ordered to be liquidated by a Hong Kong court. It now faces a complicated restructuring process that some investors think could last more than a decade. China's property industry, a pillar of the world's second-largest economy, has lurched from one crisis to another since 2021 after a regulatory crackdown on debt-fuelled construction triggered a liquidity squeeze. A string of developers have defaulted on their repayment obligations since then, and many of them have either launched or are in the process of starting debt restructuring processes to avoid facing bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings. \"RADICAL ACTIONS\"Country Garden said would continue to \"proactively communicate and work with its offshore creditors on its restructuring plan\" as it aimed to announce terms to the market as soon as practicable. Country Garden's debt restructuring process, which gathered momentum in recent weeks, is set to be clouded by the liquidation petition. \"The radical actions of a single creditor will not have a significant impact on our company's guaranteed delivery of buildings, normal operations and the overall restructuring of overseas debts,\" Country Garden said in statement to Reuters. Investment holding company Kingboard in October became one of the first known listed companies to take legal action against Country Garden when its unit Ever Credit, which is owed HK$1.6 billion ($204 million), issued a statutory demand seeking repayment. Country Garden has appointed KPMG and law firm Sidley Austin as advisers to examine its capital structure and liquidity position and formulate what it called a \"holistic\" solution. The company in October missed a $15 million bond coupon repayment and so-called ad hoc bondholder groups were formed consisting of international and fund manager investors. \"Country Garden has taken way too long, messing around with switching advisors and wasting time, so it's no surprise people lose their patience and would rather liquidate them,\" a Country Garden dollar bond investor told Reuters.",

    "content": "Nita Ambani, wife of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, is likely to be appointed chair of the board when Reliance Industries and Walt Disney merge their India media assets, two sources familiar with the plans said. Reliance, controlled by the Ambani family, and Disney are closing in on signing their India media merger deal which has been in the works for months, and an announcement is likely late Wednesday, the sources said. The plans could change ahead of an official announcement. Reliance did not respond to a request for comment, while Disney declined to comment. Nita Ambani and her family are often seen with Bollywood stars at parties they organize. She is also the founder of the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre in Mumbai which has become a key venue for music and theatre. Reliance and Disney each have a streaming service as well as 120 television channels between them, and the deal will strengthen Reliance's hold over India's $28 billion media and entertainment market. Reuters previously reported that Reliance is likely to have a 51%-54% stake in the merged entity, a deal that will value Disney's Indian operations at just $3.5 billion, sharply lower than the $15-$16 billion estimated in 2019. Bodhi Tree, a joint venture between James Murdoch and former top Disney executive, Uday Shankar, is also set to take a stake of around 9% in the new merged entity. Disney will hold around 40%. Disney's TV and streaming business in India has struggled over the years, with its digital platform facing an exodus of users amid stiff competition with Ambani's platform over cricket streaming.

Reuters had earlier reported that Adani Green Energy was looking to raise around $500 million by issuing dollar bonds in March, making it the first Adani group company to return to the overseas bond market in a year. The issue would be subject to market conditions and the weighted average life of the bonds could be around 12.7 years, the company said.

A report by U.S. short seller Hindenburg Research in January last year had led to a sell-off in stocks and overseas listed bonds of Adani group companies, forcing them to retreat from the foreign currency bond market and buyback $315 million of listed overseas debt securities. Since then, most of the group's foreign bonds are back above the levels they traded at before the Hindenburg report, giving the company comfort to look at a fresh issue of dollar bonds.",

    "content": "India's western state of Maharashtra will inspect outlets of global fast-food brands to check if they use cheese alternatives in products wrongly promoted as containing real cheese, widening scrutiny beyond a crackdown on McDonald's, a top official said. The checks threaten to cause a headache for global brands after recent inflationary pressure hit consumption of burgers and pizzas that are pricey for many Indian consumers, prompting firms to launch of discounted offerings. McDonald's biggest India franchisee, Westlife Foodworld, has been defending its use of \"real cheese\" after media reported that state authorities last year found some products made use of so-called cheese analogues of vegetable oil, rather than real cheese. It renamed a \"corn and cheese burger\" as an \"American vegetarian burger\", for example. Inspectors of the state's Food and Drug Administration will now visit all McDonald's outlets, as well as those of other major brands, to check for similar violations of display and labelling rules, its chief, Abhimanyu Kale, told Reuters. \"We are planning to check all outlets of McDonald's,\" he said. \"We will also take action on other well-known and frequently visited global fast-food chain outlets,\" he added, but declined to identify the brands being targeted. Another senior state government official, who sought anonymity, said inspectors would visit Indian franchisee outlets of brands such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, Burger King and KFC. Indian state authorities have the power to suspend the licences of restaurants found to have infringed food and safety regulations in a way that misleads consumers. Westlife, which runs McDonald's in west and south India, will welcome any inspections and maintains the \"highest standards\", its managing director, Saurabh Kalra, said. Domino's franchisee Jubilant FoodWorks, Burger King operator Restaurant Brands Asia, and Devyani International, which operates Yum Brands', Pizza Hut and KFC in India, did not respond to Reuters queries. Another Pizza Hut operator, India's Sapphire Foods, declined comment. India's western state of Maharashtra is its second most populous. Home to the financial capital Mumbai and many urban cities, it is a key market for global fast-food brands. In the McDonald's case, state food inspectors suspended the licence of one outlet east of Mumbai in November for allegedly using analogues in products promoted as containing cheese. The suspension was later revoked on appeal by Westlife, the McDonald's franchisee. The company reassured many consumers online who voiced concerns about its cheese offerings, saying on social network X that it uses \"globally approved gold-standard suppliers\". \"Our cheese is made from real milk only and we do not use any substitutes or cheese analogues,\" it said on Monday.",

    "content": "Global companies are setting up more offices in India and expanding in-house teams but that does not mean the end of the road for Indian IT firms, which rely heavily on outsourcing deals, executives said at a Nasscom event last week. Companies opened 118 global capability centers (GCCs) in India over the past two years in a boost to 'insourcing' efforts, taking their total count to over 1,620, February data from the industry body showed. IT firms are helping GCCs scale up, innovate and do much more, said Ananth Chandramouli, the India managing director of French IT firm Capgemini. Other industry insiders agreed. Satish HC, executive vice president and co-head of delivery at India's No.2 software services exporter Infosys, said its strategy was to work with GCCs, no matter which route they took to drive innovation. \"If somebody wants to scale up their captive (offshore unit), we will co-exist and work with them. If somebody wants to create a captive and ask us for a BOT (build-operate-transfer) deal, we will be glad to do a BOT deal,\" he said, adding that it was important to \"be collaborative and not be prescriptive\". The comments come as some industry watchers are cautioning that India's rise as a GCC powerhouse could dent the revenue of IT firms, which have made a fortune by helping address overseas clients' tech needs. \"Overall revenue growth can be impacted for companies with high exposure to heavily insourcing clients,\" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a December note, referring to the banking, financial services and insurance sectors in particular. \"While insourcing has been on the rise, it has not reached alarming levels yet.\" Attendees at the Nasscom event sang a different tune, saying that the two models could co-exist. \"MNCs are not taking outsourced spend and rechanneling it to GCCs, most of the GCC ramp-up is driven by migration of existing insourced spend,\" said Anuj Kadyan, senior partner at consulting firm McKinsey. Some said the pie was big enough for everyone. \"There is enough tech spends to be shared between GCCs and traditional IT players. The usual ratio is 60% is insourced and 40% with outsourced partners,\" said SAP Labs India Managing Director Sindhu Gangadharan. \"We don't see any changes in that.\"",

    "content": "Mizuho Financial Group Inc.’s showcase of its business ties at Mumbai’s luxury St Regis hotel this month underscored its growing foothold in India, a market that has lately been endorsed by Wall Street giants. An awards ceremony to fete financial professionals drew more than 150 executives from companies, including those backed by the country’s richest men Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, according to people familiar with the matter. The Japanese bank hosted the event that’s now in its second year to build closer ties with the business community. It came as Mizuho announced its biggest-ever acquisition in India. Mizuho’s celebration with its biggest clients also underscores inroads made by Japan megabanks in the world’s most populous country as global banks look for alternatives to China. They’ve vaulted to become the country’s largest arrangers of offshore loans, tapping into the appetite of tycoons to grow their empire. When the Adani Group sought to tout its deep bank ties last year in its rebuttal against short seller Hindenburg Research’s allegations, the Japanese lenders surfaced on the list as major backers in Asia. Mizuho’s bigger Japanese peers Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. rank among the top arrangers of Indian offshore loans in the last few years. They were toppled by HSBC Holdings Plc. last year. Notably, the Wall Street banks so far have rarely featured highly in these league tables. Major US banks may be more constrained by concerns over backlash from their shareholders on their lending relationships, especially those that are in the spotlight for negative news, people familiar with the matter said. Mizuho’s loan portfolio has shifted from lending largely to government entities to backing large Indian companies, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing strategic information. The bank hired Piyush Agarwal from HSBC in 2019 where he was previously head of large local corporates in India. It has also tapped several senior client coverage bankers from other rivals to help expand its customer base, the people said, helping it forge lending ties with Reliance, JSW Group and Tata Group companies. “India’s potential is not limited to its population,” a Mizuho spokesman said in response to queries from Bloomberg News. “Multiple factors are behind its potential: English being its official second language, plenty of math and IT talents, geographic advantage being in the middle of Indian Ocean, connecting Asia and Western Europe.” He said the bank plans to further grow in the country, without elaborating.  At Japan’s biggest bank MUFG, Shashank Joshi, deputy chief executive officer in India, is seen as the key driver for its business in the country, helping to form bridges with the most important companies and local lenders. During the throes of Adani’s Hindenburg crisis for example, MUFG was among lenders that facilitated roadshows across the world as the conglomerate sought to win back investor trust. MUFG CEO Hironori Kamezawa told Bloomberg News in an interview last year that India’s appeal is rising in comparison with China, and the bank continues to push growth there. At Sumitomo Mitsui, its new CEO Toru Nakashima said Japan’s second-largest lender is mulling how to become more of a full-fledged financial player in India. The banks didn’t elaborate further on their ambitions. Chief business officer Rakesh Garg who joined Sumitomo Mitsui from Barclays Plc after more than 15 years at the British firm has been working to expand the client base and is also focusing on green financing, the people said. Sandeep Chopra, a veteran banker who was most recently at DBS Group Holdings Ltd., joined the bank in December to head its corporate coverage. “Familiarity and success in the Indian market further incentivize Japanese banks to expand their operations in India,” said Sridharan.",

    "content": "Latest Household Consumption Expenditure Survey data for 2022-23 clearly elucidates the classic Engel’s Law at play in India, wherein the share of spending on food declines as income rises. Of course, higher income means increased spending on food of superior quality that costs more, but this is unlikely to reverse the overall decline of the share of food in the consumption basket.  Source: Mospi The theory can be extended to a country-wide scale and shows that countries with higher average household income see a lower proportion of income spent on food – which is measured by the Engel coefficient that reflects its economic status. A decreasing Engel coefficient usually indicates economic growth with a rising income level in the country. That should be music to the ears of anyone doing business in India and seems like a no-brainer for the fifth largest economy marching its way for the coveted third spot within a decade. Interestingly, the long-term data from 1999-00 to 2022-23 shows a compounded annual growth of over 9 percent in average monthly per capita expenditure for both rural and urban, highlighting the importance and growth potential of both the markets. Source: Mospi While the first cut data points to India taking baby steps to the path of prosperity, is it more equitable? Although the answer isn’t straightforward from average monthly expenditure data, the gap between the expenditure of top 5 percent and bottom 5 percent shows greater inequality in urban areas than rural, with significant ramification for consumption companies targeting large urban markets.  Source: Mospi Where is India spending and what are people discarding from their shopping baskets? Following copybook Engel’s law both urban and rural consumers are spending less on cereals, pulses, sugar and salt as a percentage of total expenditure. That doesn’t mean all is lost for staples companies. Within the categories, there is a subtle but sure shift towards premium products. For instance, in both rural and urban areas, the categories that are maintaining or improving share are milk and milk products, fruits, proteins (egg, fish \u0026 meat) as well as processed food. Source: Mospi The change in consumption basket spells good news for the organized food companies. There seems to be a common theme on where India wants to put its incremental expenditure. Both rural and urban have strong inclination for spending on addiction items such as pan, tobacco and intoxicants, toilet articles and other consumables, conveyance and durable goods. Overall, discretionary categories are leading from the front in urban areas and are also making their presence felt in rural. In the equity markets, companies focused on discretionary consumption/premiumization have done well and should only do better as the country travels the path of becoming a middle-income nation.  Source: Mospi Which Indian states look promising from a consumption demand viewpoint? Finally, a word on the state-level data shows Chandigarh as the most promising urban market and Sikkim the wealthiest rural market. Chattisgarh is at the bottom, for both. Going strictly by the expenditure data, the size of average urban expenditure is 1.7x that of rural for the country as a whole.  However, the skew of expenditure in favour of urban is more in states like Meghalaya, Chattisgarh, Assam, Odisha, Gujarat and Karnataka. Overall, the data is a nascent indicator of India’s long but steady journey towards becoming a wealthier nation with implications for varied consumption categories, companies that are likely to lead from the front in this journey and how investors should participate in this growth story.",

The fund’s initial investment of $1.9 billion in March has ballooned to $10 billion in value, helped by market gains and additional stakes, according to fund manager Sudarshan Murthy. This marks a big win for the contrarian bet by veteran Rajiv Jain’s firm after Hindenburg accused the Adani Group of stock-price manipulation and accounting fraud — charges that the conglomerate has repeatedly denied. The Gautam Adani-led group has recovered more than two-thirds of the market capitalization that it lost following the report, after it wooed investors and bankers. India’s top court has also rejected a high-level probe into Hindenburg’s allegations. “Adani Power is the country’s largest private thermal power producer,” and may double its capacity through 2029, Murthy said. Meanwhile, Adani Green Energy Ltd. has secured land “that gives them a clear runway where they can build in the next five years,” he added.

    "content": "A consortium backed by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. and India’s top engineering schools aim to launch its first ChatGPT-style service next month, a big step in the country’s ambitions to become a player in the field of artificial intelligence. The BharatGPT group, encompassing an arm of India’s most valuable company and eight affiliated universities, offered a sneak peek of the large language model Tuesday during a technology conference in Mumbai. In a video played before delegates, a motorcycle mechanic in southern India queried an AI bot in his native Tamil, a banker conversed with the tool in Hindi, and a developer in Hyderabad used it to write computer code. If successful, the model — dubbed Hanooman after the half-monkey Hindu deity — will represent an advance for India in the accelerating race to develop potentially transformative AI technology. BharatGPT envisions the model working via 11 local languages in four main fields: health care, governance, financial services and education. It developed the model in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology universities including in Bombay, backed by wireless carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. and India’s government. “It’s a different genre of LLMs,” said Ganesh Ramakrishnan, chair of IIT Bombay’s department of computer science and engineering. Hanooman will also offer speech-to-text capabilities, making it vastly more user-friendly, he said in an interview on the sidelines of the annual Nasscom IT industry conference. In a country of 1.4 billion, millions cannot read or write. Reliance Jio will build customized models for specific uses, he said. The telecom-to-retail conglomerate is already working on Jio Brain, a platform to use AI across a network of about 450 million subscribers. LLMs are systems that learn from vast quantities of data and generate natural-sounding responses. Such models harness generative AI, a newer type of artificial intelligence popularized by the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. BharatGPT’s effort in this space is somewhat unique — it’s the first private-public partnership of its kind in the country, and involves major players in disparate fields. “It’s like the Indian joint family,” Ramakrishnan said, referring to inter-generational family structures still common in the country. “We are interdependent, and we do better together.” Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.",

    "description": "India stunned investors last month by abruptly suspending most activities of the banking affiliate of Paytm, a once high-flying fintech star that had attracted backing from Warren Buffett and SoftBank Group Corp. India banks’ rush for clients set for reckoning after PaytmRelated stories",
    "content": "For Indian regulators seeking to crack down on potential fraud in the financial sector, Paytm may just be the beginning. India stunned investors last month by abruptly suspending most activities of the banking affiliate of Paytm, a once high-flying fintech star that had attracted backing from Warren Buffett and SoftBank Group Corp. While the Paytm case was an extreme example of lapses in customer verification — it allegedly used a single identity document to open thousands of accounts — the crackdown signals growing impatience from authorities. Hardly a day passes when a bank or fintech firm isn’t fined for failing to properly vet its customers, ensnaring top lenders from State Bank of India to Citigroup Inc. Fed up with the persistent shortcomings, the Reserve Bank of India is likely to get even tougher before Governor Shaktikanta Das steps down this year. Regulatory concerns are rising as lenders rush to open more accounts and mop up deposits to meet the soaring demand for loans in the fastest-growing major economy. Most banks typically outsource the last mile of customer verification to third-party firms or so-called runners, and leakages occur at many points in that largely paper process, according to Ashok Hariharan, chief executive officer of IDfy, which provides client vetting services to banks and fintechs firms in India. While big banks can do more, it’s a challenge dealing with firms that don’t have strict fraud and risk teams, he said. RBI Governor Das has repeatedly warned about the need to strengthen risk management in banks and shadow lenders. Even though bad debts are at a more than decade low, these lapses in customer verification have been among major concerns for the central bank. “The interest of depositors and customers is of prime importance,” Das said in a post-monetary policy briefing this month. “Financial stability is of prime importance.” While Indian banks have boosted spending on technology to detect potential money laundering and prevent fraud, the cases are rising. The number of reported frauds of more than 100,000 rupees ($1,205) rose 68% to more than 14,000 from April to September last year, almost triple the rate for the previous six-month period, according to an RBI report. The sharpest increase of fraud cases was in credit cards, online transactions and deposits, the data show. RBI, which can levy a maximum penalty of 50 million rupees for violations, imposed fines of 400 million rupees in the fiscal year that ended in March, down from 650.3 million rupees the prior year. Still, in the current fiscal year, the frequency of such fines has increased sharply, as can be parsed from the central bank’s website. “RBI getting stricter on KYC is the right thing to do, and people are going to get serious about it now,” said IDfy’s Hariharan. “In many instances, there is a frivolous attitude toward KYC.” Customer data in the country has been misused, according to Hariharan. In a typical set-up, fraudsters pay runners who collect so-called Know-Your-Customer documents for bank customers and offer them as little as 500 rupees for the data, he said. This allows fraudsters to operate multiple bank accounts from the identity theft, and they collect money in these accounts by duping customers largely through phishing calls, he added. CrackdownIn addition to its crackdown on banks, RBI ordered Visa Inc. this month to immediately stop a payments service where cards were used to transact with merchants who weren’t allowed to accept such payments. Yet no recent case has drawn as much attention as Paytm, controlled by billionaire Vijay Shekhar Sharma. The firm burst onto India’s equity markets in 2021 with a $2.5 billion initial public offering, the largest ever in the country and attracted a who’s who of global investors. Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank was on board, as was China fintech giant Ant Group Co. and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Its affiliate company, which takes deposits and offers payment services much like PayPal Holdings Inc., has been in the regulator’s crosshairs. On Jan. 31, India’s central bank barred Paytm Payments Bank Ltd. from accepting fresh credits in its customer accounts or mobile wallets after Feb. 29. Bloomberg News has reported that hundreds of thousands of customers didn’t submit their KYC documentation. The RBI move dealt a big blow to Paytm and sent its stock tumbling. Regulators last week extended that deadline to March 15, and Paytm is in talks with other banks to clear merchant payments.  Compliance and accountability are big challenges for the financial system, which now includes a lot of links among banks, fintechs and others, according to K.V. Karthik, who leads the financial services sector for Deloitte in India. “With such a sharp growth in so many small fintech firms in the ecosystem, RBI probably wants to put out a stern and clear message that everyone must follow rules very seriously,” said Gefion Capital’s Agarwal.",

    "content": "With the proposed merger of its Indian arm with Zee terminated, Sony will seek various options, including finding another opportunity to replace the plan and organic growth opportunities in India, which has great potential in the long term, according to a top company official. In an earnings call, Hiroki Totoki, president, COO \u0026 CFO of Sony said India is a very appealing market where it would continue to invest. \"India, on a long-term basis, has a great growth potential. It's a very appealing market. Therefore, we will try to seek various opportunities and if we can find another opportunity that would replace this type of plan,\" Totoki said when asked about the company's strategy in India after the termination of the proposed merger. The earnings call was held on February 14. As per the merger conditions, which was agreed upon between Sony and ZEEL, the Japanese giant was also supposed to invest $1.5 billion in the merged entity. The group will also continue to pursue organic growth as per its strategy in India, where it operates through Culver Max Entertainment (earlier known as Sony Pictures Network India), he said in the investors call. Sony had last month terminated an agreement with ZEEL to merge its two Indian entities — Culver Max Entertainment and Bangla Entertainment Private Limited (BEPL) — with ZEEL. Sony Group Corporation (SGC) had said ZEEL did not satisfy the merger conditions and initiated arbitration proceedings before SIAC claiming $90 million (around Rs 748.5 crore) as a termination fee. ZEEL filed a petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), seeking a direction to Sony Group to implement the merger scheme. On February 4, the Singapore International Arbitration Center (SIAC) denied Sony Group's interim plea to restrain ZEEL from moving NCLT for enforcing the failed merger. The Mumbai bench of NCLT has already issued notice to Sony over a petition filed in this regard. The NCLT had on August 10, 2023, approved the scheme of merger, which could have created a USD 10 billion media entity. If the merger was completed, the combined entity would have owned over 70 TV channels, two video streaming services — ZEE5 and Sony LIV — and two film studios — Zee Studios and Sony Pictures Films India– making it the largest entertainment network in the country. Sony Pictures Network India (SPNI), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation, Japan, owns 26 channels that operate in Hindi and several other languages having a viewership of over 700 million. Besides, it has one OTT platform Sony LIV on which it streams live sports, movies, short films and its original and archival content. It has around 33 million viewers. The company recorded a revenue of Rs 6,684 crore for FY23.",

    "description": "Currently, banks have to maintain a CRR of 4.5% on their total deposits, with no distinction provided for green deposits.SBI seeks lower reserve requirement for green deposits, chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara saysRelated stories",
    "content": "State Bank of India chairman Dinesh Khara on Friday said the nation's largest lender is in talks with the Reserve Bank to reduce the cash reserve ratio requirement on green deposits. State Bank of India (SBI) last month announced a green deposit scheme, a first in the domestic banking, to attract long-term retail deposits to be used only to fund green transition projects or climate-friendly projects. The bank said such deposits will be priced 10 basis points lower than normal deposit rates. At present, the CRR is pegged at 4.5 per cent, which means that every one rupee that a bank collects in deposits, 4.5 paise should be parked with the Reserve Bank as a solvency measure. Banks don't earn any interest from the amount reserved with RBI. \"We are engaging with the regulator for a reduction in the CRR for green deposits and secondly, if at all as a policy, it can be incorporated into the regulator policy mechanism. Early beginning has happened from the regulator's side also but maybe it will take two to three years to start having an impact on the pricing too,\" Khara said at an event organised by the Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode here. Calling for better and more practical rating as there is a high possibility of green-shoring in the name of green financing, the chairman also said the bank is engaging with rating entities to see if an accounting standard can be set for green financing. SBI has also started evaluating borrowers on environmental, social and governance rating. Pradip Chaudhary, one of the predecessors of Khara, had a long fight with the regulator after he sought interest payments from the RBI on deposits under CRR. SBI launched a green rupee fixed deposit scheme last month with tenors of 1,111, 1,777 and 2,222 days with interest rates around 10 basis points below the prevailing rates on similar tenors of regular fixed deposits at the bank. The RBI put in place a framework for accepting fixed deposits, which has been applicable since June 2023. As per the framework, financial institutions are supposed to raise green deposits first before they decide to finance green projects. The proceeds can be invested in liquid instruments with up to one year maturity.",

    "content": "Reliance Industries is in talks to buy Disney's stake in satellite TV provider Tata Play, the Business Standard newspaper reported on Thursday, as billionaire Mukesh Ambani's firm seeks to bolster its media presence. The oil-to-telecom conglomerate is looking to buy Walt Disney's 29.8% stake in the loss-making Tata Play as it seeks to offer its entire JioCinema content to Tata's customers, the newspaper reported, citing sources aware of the development. Bankers are currently valuing Disney's stake in Tata Play, which also offers access to video streaming services, the report added. Reliance, which runs multiple TV channels and JioCinema streaming app through its media unit Viacom18, is looking to strengthen its hold on India's $28-billion media and entertainment market. Tata Play swung to a loss of 1.05 billion rupees (about $13 million) in fiscal 2023, compared with a profit of 686 million rupees. Its revenues fell 5% during the same period. The Temasek-backed company had confidentially filed for a $300 million IPO more than a year ago, Economic Times reported. Reliance and Disney did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comments, while a spokesperson for Tata Play declined to respond. Reliance is close to merging its India media business with Disney with a 51%-54% stake, Reuters reported earlier this month. The deal values the U.S. giant's Indian operations at $3.5 billion. Bodhi Tree, a joint venture between James Murdoch and former top Disney executive, Uday Shankar, is also set to buy a stake of around 9% in the newly merged entity. Disney will hold around 40%. Tata Sons owns a majority stake of 50.2% in Tata Play. Singapore's Temasek holds about 20%, while Disney owns the rest. Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.",

Related stories",
    "content": "Broadcaster Zee Entertainment has turned cautious after the slow pace of recovery in advertising spending and the 3 percent on-year decline in the company’s ad revenue in the December quarter. Ad spends shifted to the Cricket World Cup, which took place in 2023 from October 5 to November 19. The tournament was aired on Disney Star’s sports channels. While there was some seasonal festive uptick in the third quarter of FY24, the overall pace of recovery in ad spends continues to be slow. Zee reported ad revenue of Rs 1,027.4 crore, down from Rs 1,063.4 crore a year earlier. Sequentially, ad revenue grew from Rs 979.2 crore in Q2. Also read: Zee Ent Q3 profit up 1.4x to Rs 58.5 crore, revenue increases 14.8% The sentiment on ad spend was similar in the previous quarter when the company said the drop in ad expenditure by edtech, fintech, foodtech, and e-commerce companies posed a challenge for broadcasters. Gradual recovery Analysts note that while the gradual recovery in ad revenue with improving spends from the FMCG segment appears to be a silver lining, the recovery will remain gradual as certain brands continue to see slower growth due to the rural slowdown. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal has revised down its operating profit and profit after tax estimates for Zee in FY25 by 8 percent and 11 percent, respectively, on the back of the laggard recovery in ad revenue. \"While our recent performance has been subdued, and a large part of this has been due to temporary and transitory factors, the structure strength and attractiveness of our business is still very strong, giving us confidence on our recovery path,\" Gupta said. Also read: Some layoffs likely at Zee, firm revisits plan as standalone entity after Sony terminates merger Focusing on improving profitability, the company has set a target of 8-10 percent overall revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate) with the current portfolio and expects digital to grow at a faster pace. Streaming platform Zee5's revenue in Q3 rose 14.9 percent YoY to Rs 223.2 crore, driven by improved subscription. Its operating loss narrowed to Rs 244 crore from Rs 282 crore a year earlier and Rs 253.9 crore in Q2. During Q3, the over the top (OTT) platform launched 19 shows and movies including five originals. The broadcaster will revise its OTT cost structure in Zee5, which is already at its peak. Zee will also revisit the overall cost structure across tech, content, marketing, and people with a view to reset to a lower cost baseline as it enters FY25. The company said that it has identified several cost levers but there will be a one-time cost. \"For the next three to six months, we will likely have some pressure on margins due to increased one-time high costs towards implementing these interventions,\" Gupta said. There may be some layoffs in Zee Entertainment as the company rationalises employee costs to improve profitability, CEO Punit Goenka said during the Q3 earnings call. Sony terminated a merger plan with Zee last month, a deal that was signed over two years ago and was set to build a $10 billion combined entity. Sony said Zee did not satisfy the merger conditions and initiated arbitration proceedings claiming $90 million (Rs 748.5 crore) as a termination fee. Zee has said the claims against the company, including the termination fee, were not tenable.",

    "content": "State-run Coal India plans to start operations at five new mines and expand capacity of at least 16 existing ones to address growing demand for the fuel, its chairman told Reuters on Wednesday. India has increasingly relied on coal to address record power demand in recent months, with the rise in coal-fired power output outpacing renewable energy growth for the first time since at least 2019. A record output by Coal India - the world's largest coal miner whose profits and share price have surged since early 2023 - is set to boost inventories at power plants running on domestic coal by 16.1% year-over-year to 40 million metric tons by end-March, Coal India Chairman P.M. Prasad said in written response to questions. Coal India aims to boost output by more than 7% to a record 838 million tons for the next fiscal year that starts April 1, with initial stockpiles at 80 million tonnes, over 15% higher from a year earlier. The miner plans to start operations at five new mines, with a combined annual capacity of 14.3 million tons, in the next fiscal year, Prasad said. Coal India's revenue growth has outpaced an increase in costs in the recent years, but spending surged nearly 20% each in 2022 and 2023. Prasad expects higher outsourcing of mining and \"natural\" average annual attrition of 12,000-13,000 employees to help manage expenses. The company currently has over 220,000 people on its payrolls. The miner has awarded nine projects with annual capacity of 83 million tons to private companies, with another two projects capable of producing 32 million tons likely to be awarded before March-end, Prasad said. The company, which has been building solar and coal-fired power generating plants in efforts to diversify, is scouting for lithium assets in Australia, as India looks to secure access to minerals critical to the energy transition. \"We are participating in exploration of lithium assets in Australia that are currently under development stage, and potential long term assets,\" Prasad said, adding that preliminary talks with Australian companies are ongoing. He declined to give further details. Last year's decline in global coal prices from 2022's historic highs prompted Indian traders and users to increase imports of thermal coal, which rose 9.4% to 176.3 million tons in the year ended December 2023. Non-power users were avid buyers of imported coal, Prasad said. Meanwhile, lower seaborne coal prices have resulted in a decline in Coal India's margins on what are usually lucrative spot auction sales, though volumes offered through auctions rose nearly 80% to 73 million tons in the ten months ended January. The company is on track to auction about 20% of its output for the year that ends March, and will continue to offer between 10% and 20% of its production through auctions, said Prasad, a longtime insider who was promoted to chairman in July.",

    "content": "Adani Green Energy is likely to raise $500 million by issuing dollar bonds in March, two officials aware of the plans said, making it the first Adani group company to return to the overseas bond market in a year. \"The company is doing the groundwork and talking to investors to get a sense on pricing,\" said a foreign banker, who is a part of the discussions. \"Once there's more clarity on pricing and demand, they will finalise the details and tap the market,\" the banker said. Both the officials and the banker spoke on condition of anonymity as they are not authorised to speak to the media. Adani Group did not respond to Reuters' e-mail seeking comment. A report by U.S. short seller Hindenburg Research in January last year had led to a sell-off in stocks and overseas listed bonds of Adani group companies, forcing them to retreat from the foreign currency bond market and buyback $315 million of listed overseas debt securities. Since then, most of the group's foreign bonds are back above the levels they traded at before the Hindenburg report, giving the company comfort to look at a fresh issue of dollar bonds. Adani Green Energy conducted non-deal roadshows in January and reached out to investors in Hong Kong and Singapore. It will soon start roadshows for the proposed bond issue, the officials said without elaborating on the timing. The company is in talks with foreign banks and investors and is yet to appoint arrangers for this issue, the banker said. \"The spreads for Adani Group's dollar bonds have definitely come down from last year, so the deal should get reasonably priced,\" according to the banker. Adani Green Energy recently completed the funding to redeem its $750 million bonds due in September, eight months before they mature. On Tuesday, Moody's revised Adani Green's rating outlook to \"stable\" from \"negative\" considering the company's improved financial flexibility and reduced refinancing risk after the repayment of senior notes. The rating agency also affirmed Adani Green's Ba3 rating, which reflects predictable cash flow backed by long-term power purchase agreements and high financial leverage. Among other Adani group companies, Adani Transmission may also tap the overseas bond market this year, according to merchant bankers.",

Given our business has high operating leverage, despite effective cost management, EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) margins has declined to 10.2 percent. Net profit for the quarter and year was impacted by merger expenses related exceptional items which came to about Rs 60.3 crore during the quarter,\" said Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Rohit Gupta.

    "content": "The contract between Zee Entertainment and Star India for the television rights of ICC cricket may get terminated over the alleged breach of the Alliance Agreement between the two parties, which they had agreed upon for the sports rights deal. Star India had sent letters to Zee alleging a breach of the agreement during the December quarter of FY24 on account of non-payment of dues for the rights concerning the first instalment of the rights fee aggregating to $203.56 million or Rs 1,693.42 crore. This was along with the payment for bank guarantee commission and deposit interest aggregating Rs 17 crore and financial commitments including furnishing of corporate guarantee confirmation as stated in the alliance agreement, Zee said in a document released along with its Q3FY24 results on February 13. On the other hand, Zee said that Star has not acted as per the agreement and has failed to obtain necessary approvals, and execution of necessary documentation and agreements. The company's management believes that Star by its conduct has breached the Alliance Agreement and is in default of the terms thereof and consequently, the contract stands repudiated. Zee said that it has communicated to Star that the alliance agreement cannot be preceded and has sought a refund of Rs 68.54 crore paid to Star. Claims made by Sony, including demand of $90-mn termination fee, not tenable: Zee Entertainment Case history On August 26, 2022, Zee entered into an Alliance Agreement with Star India Private Limited in which Star would grant sub-licensing rights concerning television broadcasting rights of the International Cricket Council's, (ICC) Men's and Under 19 (U-19) global events for a period of four years (ICC 2024-2027) on an exclusive basis. Disney Star acquired the ICC TV and digital rights for India from 2024 to 2027 for $3 billion. It retained the digital rights and sub-licensed the TV rights for the men's and Under-19 global events to Zee. The ICC Under-19 Men's Cricket World Cup 2024, held from January 19 to February 11, was the first tournament under the new media rights cycle. While Zee said that it had identified this acquisition of strategic importance, analysts have pointed out that the deal would result in annual losses of Rs 1,520 crore in FY25 and beyond due to high content cost, lowersports ad revenue and cricket content are available for free on streaming platform. In addition, after Sony terminated the merger, experts had said that Zee may not be able to fulfil this commitment of the ICC sports rights deal with a cash balance of Rs 600 crore. While some legal experts have said that Disney Star may not hesitate to take Zee to court if it fails to honour the agreement, Zee has said that it has strong and valid grounds to defend any claims.",

    "content": "Kalyani Steel Limited has proposed to invest Rs 26,000 crore to set up a titanium metal and aerospace components manufacturing and integrated advanced specialty steel and automotive components manufacturing complex at Gajamara in Odisha's Dhenkanal district, an official said on Tuesday. The state cabinet on Monday evening approved a special incentive for the unit as it is going to be the first aerospace and defence manufacturing complex in Odisha, Chief Secretary P K Jena said while briefing media persons here. He said the state government is committed to foster a conducive environment for growth and innovation, particularly in the high-potential sectors of aerospace, defence and automotive manufacturing. Further vendor development will lead to significant employment opportunities in the subsequent years. The jobs will primarily be in the high-end high-skill sector and will open up new avenues for the youth of Odisha, he added. The chief secretary said the requirement of high end-high skill jobs will be achieved in collaboration with local ITIs and polytechnics, adding, that these tie-ups for up-skilling in the auto-components, specialty steel and alloys manufacturing sector will boost Odisha's skilling landscape and has the potential to make Odisha the skill capital of India for new-age tech. The project will bring in vendors in the areas of manufacturing and service sectors that will provide a boost to the local MSMEs and start-ups, which will further create additional employment and entrepreneurship in the region, he asserted. The state government is enthusiastic about this collaboration with the Kalyani Group and will provide all necessary support for the fruition of these projects. \"We look forward to witnessing the manifold benefits these initiatives will bring to the people of Odisha, marking a new chapter in the state's journey towards becoming a hub of manufacturing excellence\", he stated.",

    "content": "LTIMindtree, India's No.6 IT services provider by revenue, has identified two internal candidates for the top job as it is unlikely to extend CEO Debashis Chatterjee's term that is set to end next year, according to two persons familiar with the matter. Chief Operating Officer Nachiket Deshpande and President Sudhir Chaturvedi are the front-runners for the role as the board prefers to have an insider at the helm of the company, one of the persons said. LTIMindtree and the executives did not respond to Reuters' requests seeking comment. \"The risk to cohesion and culture seems to be a key concern among the selection team. Going outside would only work if that leader could continue unifying the two sides,\" Constellation Research founder Ray Wang said. Tech veteran Chatterjee, aged 58 and better known as \"DC\", took the reins of LTIMindtree in November 2022, after the merger of Larsen \u0026 Toubro firms L\u0026T Infotech and Mindtree in the same month. His term at the company, in which the infra giant held a 68.6% stake as of December 2023, is due to end in late 2025. \"Nachiket (Deshpande), who is also the current CEO's protégé since his Cognizant days, has been the CEO-in-waiting for a while,\" one of the persons said. \"So, it is a question of when, not if, DC will hand over the reins to him.\" Deshpande and Chaturvedi are taking more calls and responsibilities these days than before, the person added. LTIMindtree's rivals have also seen changes at the top. Industry leader Tata Consultancy Services elevated insider K Krithivasan as CEO last year after Rajesh Gopinathan quit abruptly, while Infosys veteran Mohit Joshi took over as Tech Mahindra CEO in December 2023. Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte's five-year term is set to end in July 2025, according to an exchange filing. Chatterjee's successor will face an uphill task of boosting the fortunes of a company, which is yet to fully benefit from the merger. \"Management highlighted that a weak macro environment played spoilsport to synergy realisation. We partly agree, but also believe that execution could have been better,\" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a post-earnings note last month. The C-suite changes could shake up the IT industry. \"Expect to see intensifying competition as each new head brings in new strategies for growth. The industry has been in a rut with growth slowing down and staying in the lower single digits for most (companies),\" Omdia Research's Hansa Iyengar said. She expects the new leaders to shuffle portfolios, renew focus on areas such as artificial intelligence and cloud, and double down on measures to improve efficiencies and margins. \"It will be good for the industry to have a shake-up of sorts,\" Iyengar, the principal analyst at the tech advisory firm, said.",

As a leading global steel company, Tata Steel recognises the importance of \"breaking the glass ceiling and mainstreaming transgender people\" in society, it said. \"Transgender candidates with any of the following qualifications can apply: Matriculation in English or ITI or graduation in any discipline or diploma in engineering in any discipline from any institute recognised by AICTE or UGC or Degree in BE/B Tech in any discipline from any institute, recognised by AICTE or UGC,\" Tata Steel said in a notification. All shortlisted candidates will undergo a selection process, which may include a written test and interview as per the requirement, it said. In February 2022, the steel giant had expanded its transgender employee base by onboarding 12 crane operator trainees from the LGBTQ+ community at its Kalinganagar plant in Odisha. Prior to this, Tata Steel's captive mining division in Jharkhand's West Bokaro had onboarded 14 transgender people as Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) operators at its mines. \"The well-thought intervention has not only broached the unorthodox subject of hiring transgender in the blue collar workforce, but also provided a map for other organisations to navigate the difficult path to being inclusive in the truest sense,\" a company official said. It laid the groundwork of hiring minority groups by first improving their gender diversity ratio by inducting more women employees in core operations before moving on to recruiting transgenders in the mining division, he said.

    "content": "Vedanta is working \"actively\" for demerger of its key businesses, including aluminium, into separate listed companies and the process is likely to be completed in next nine to 12 months, a top official of the company said. Billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta Ltd had last year announced creation of independent verticals through demerger of its metal, power, aluminium, and oil and gas businesses to unlock potential value. In an interview to PTI, John Slaven, CEO of aluminium business of Vedanta, said, \"We are working very actively in securing the successful demerger of the aluminium business.\" The process for the demerger is currently underway and is subject to a number of approvals from various authorities, he added. The move, he said, will be an evolutionary step for Vedanta's aluminium business as it will help Vedanta Aluminium to chart out its own course. \"I think more fundamentally it enables our investors and Vedanta Resources to really have a much better understanding of the opportunities and potential of the aluminium business. \"It will become much more visible as it would be a pure-play. We will have a dedicated management team, a dedicated board of directors will be able to chart our own strategy with input from the investor community,\" Slaven said. About capacity expansion plans for 2024-25, he said that the company will see a significant change in its business because the refinery expansions at Lanjigarh will be effectively completed by the end of next fiscal year. \"We are expanding our BALCO smelter, so we are essentially going from 5,50,000 tonnes to a million tonnes, Slaven said, adding that the production is expected to come in the late second quarter or in the beginning of the third quarter, and progressively ramp up during the rest of FY25. \"We are also completing expansion of our value-added products. We are adding billet capacity, we are adding capacity for foundry alloy, we are increasing the capacity of our rolled products business so we are taking that from 44,000 tonnes to about 100,000 tonnes. So a lot of that is going to be completed during the next fiscal,\" he said. The production at Vedanta's Sijimali bauxite mine will begin in the third quarter of next financial year, he said. Besides, the company's additional three coal mines -- Kuraloi, Radhikapur, Ghogharpalli -- will start production in about nine to 18 months. Vedanta Aluminium, a business of Vedanta Limited, is the country's leading producer of aluminium, manufacturing more than half of India's aluminium i.e., 2.29 million tonnes in FY'23. It is also into value-added aluminium products that find critical applications in core downstream industries.",

    "description": "In November 2020, Paytm Payments Services submitted an application to the RBI seeking a licence to function as a payment aggregator, following the guidelines outlined in the Regulation of Payment Aggregators and Payment Gateways.Govt examining FDI flow from China in Paytm Payments ServicesRelated stories",
    "content": "The Centre is reportedly examining foreign direct investment (FDI) originating from China in Paytm Payments Services Ltd (PPSL), the payment aggregator subsidiary of One97 Communications Ltd (OCL), news agency PTI reported, citing sources. PPSL had applied for a licence with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in November 2020 to operate as a payment aggregator under the guidelines on Regulation of Payment Aggregators and Payment Gateways. However, in November 2022, RBI rejected PPSL’s application and instructed the company to resubmit it to comply with Press Note 3 under FDI rules. Notably, OCL counts investment from Chinese firm Ant Group Co. Following the banking regulator’s directive, the company submitted the requisite application on December 14, 2022, to the Centre concerning the past downward investment from OCL into PPSL, aiming to adhere to Press Note 3 outlined under FDI guidelines. An inter-ministerial committee is currently engaged in scrutinising investments originating from China in PPSL. A decision regarding the FDI matter is expected post due consideration and a thorough examination of all relevant aspects, according to the news agency. In accordance with Press Note 3, the government has mandated prior approval for foreign investments in any sector from nations sharing a land border with India. This measure aims to mitigate the risk of opportunistic takeovers of domestic firms in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. The countries sharing land borders with India include China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, and Afghanistan. A spokesperson from Paytm told the news agency that PPSL had initially applied for an online Payment Aggregator (PA) application catering to online merchants. Following this, the central bank instructed PPSL to obtain requisite approvals for past downward investment and then resubmit the application accordingly. Also Read | Without RBI migration approval, Paytm's UPI business faces an existential crisis \"This is part of the regular process where everybody applying for a payment aggregator licence has to get FDI approval,\" the spokesperson said. According to the spokesperson, PPSL diligently adhered to the relevant guidelines and furnished all necessary documents to the regulator within the designated timeframe. Throughout the pending process, PPSL was permitted to sustain its online payment aggregation operations for existing partners, albeit refraining from onboarding any new merchants. \"Since then the ownership structure has changed. The Paytm founder remains the largest stakeholder in the company. Ant Financial reduced its stake in OCL to less than 10 per cent in July 2023. Subsequently, it does not qualify for beneficial company ownership. OCL founding promoter now holds a 24.3 per cent stake. Therefore, your understanding of FDI from China in PPSL is incorrect and misleading,\" the spokesperson said. Last month, the RBI imposed restrictions on PPSL, prohibiting it from accepting deposits or top-ups in customer accounts, prepaid instruments, wallets, and FASTags, among other transactions, effective from February 29, 2024. The RBI's action against PPSL is a direct result of a thorough system audit report followed by a compliance validation report conducted by external auditors. (With inputs from PTI)",

Xiaomi, which has the biggest share in India's smartphone market at 18%, also asks in the letter dated Feb. 6 that India consider offering manufacturing incentives and lowering import tariffs for certain smartphone components.

While Chinese companies operating in India are reticent to speak publicly about the scrutiny, Xiaomi's letter shows that they continue to struggle in India, especially in the smartphone space where many critical components come from Chinese suppliers. In the letter, Xiaomi India President Muralikrishnan B. said India needed to work on \"confidence building\" measures to encourage component suppliers to setup operations locally. \"There are apprehensions among component suppliers regarding establishing operations in India, stemming from the challenges faced by companies in India, particularly from Chinese origin,\" Muralikrishnan said, without naming any companies. The letter said the concerns were related to compliance and visa issues that it didn't elaborate on, and other factors. It said \"the government should address these concerns and work to instil confidence among foreign component suppliers, encouraging them to set up manufacturing facilities in India.\" Xiaomi and the IT ministry did not respond to queries for further information and comment. Indian authorities last year accused Chinese smartphone company Vivo Communication Technology of breaching some visa rules and alleged it siphoned $13 billion in funds from India. India has also frozen more than $600 million in Xiaomi assets for alleged illegal remittances to foreign entities by passing them off as royalty payments. Both Chinese companies deny any wrongdoing. Other than regulatory scrutiny of the likes of Xiaomi and Vivo, India has since 2020 also banned more than 300 Chinese apps, including ByteDance's TikTok, and halted planned projects such as those planned by Chinese automakers BYD and Great Wall Motor. The source said many executives of Chinese electronics companies struggle to get visas to enter India, and their companies continue to face slow clearances for investments due to heavy scrutiny by New Delhi. In the letter, Xiaomi's Muralikrishnan also made a case for further lowering India's import tariffs, just after New Delhi's Jan. 31 move to reduce import taxes on battery covers and phone camera lenses. Xiaomi is also asking India to reduce import tariffs on sub-components used in batteries, USB cables and phone covers, according to the letter. Reducing the import tariffs could \"increase India's manufacturing competitiveness ... in terms of costs\", Xiaomi said in the letter, but getting component manufacturers to set up shop in India would require bigger incentives. In January, India's top industrial policy bureaucrat Rajesh Kumar Singh signalled that India could ease its heightened scrutiny of Chinese investments if the two countries' border remains peaceful.",

    "content": "Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s conglomerate has signed contracts to buy 1.6 million tons a year of copper concentrate for the world’s largest single-location smelter for the industrial metal. The first 500,000 tons of capacity at the $1.2 billion facility in Mundra in the western state of Gujarat is set to start operations next month, according to Vinay Prakash, chief executive officer at Adani Natural Resources. This will be expanded to 1 million tons by March 2029 to cater for a forecast doubling of Indian copper demand by the end of the decade, he said in an interview. Adani Enterprises Ltd., the port-to-power conglomerate’s flagship company, is seeking resource security in critical minerals and is resuming capital expenditure now that its shares have stabilized after a short-seller attack in January 2023. The smelter is starting up just as the global copper market experiences a collapse in the fees that processors charge miners because there’s not enough ore to go around. The concentrate deals are a mix of short- and long-term arrangements, Prakash said, without disclosing the suppliers. Concentrate supply is likely to increase in the medium- to long-term as more mining projects, including in Africa and Peru, come on stream, he said.",

    "content": "British American Tobacco Plc’s shares rose after it said it was trying to overcome regulatory hurdles to selling at least part of its stake in Indian company ITC, valued at more than £14 billion ($17.7 billion). BAT has “been actively working for some time on completing the regulatory process required to give us the flexibility to monetise some of our shareholding,” it said in full-year results, released Thursday. “This would be a big positive,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones, “accelerating BAT’s deleveraging and bringing the all-important share buyback timeline closer for investors.” Owen Bennett, an analyst at Jefferies, said it was the “strongest signal yet” around the potential stake sale. WritedownBAT also used the results to increase a writedown on the value of its US cigarette brands, due to the number of Americans quitting smoking. BAT now estimates the non-cash impairment charge related to its US brands at more than £27 billion ($34.1 billion), from an original estimate of £25 billion disclosed in December. That pushed the company to an annual operating loss of £15.8 billion last year, it said Thursday. The maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes, Vuse vapes and Velo nicotine pouches said the smoke-free business achieved profitability two years ahead of schedule and accounted for 16.5% of revenue in its 2023 financial results. While continuing to sell billions of cigarettes each year, Big Tobacco companies are shifting to alternative products such as vapes, heated tobacco and nicotine pouches that they say are less harmful. More people are quitting smoking as governments in major markets including the UK and US increasingly crack down on tobacco use. At the same time, politicians and health regulators are also moving to ban disposable or flavored vapes over concerns about use among young people despite their value as smoking cessation aids. BAT reported adjusted operating income of £12.5 billion and revenue of £27.3 billion. Analysts expected adjusted operating income of £12.6 billion and £27.7 billion in sales, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company changed its CEO in May last year.",

    "content": "Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL), the nation's biggest city gas operator, is looking to set up as many as 19 compressed biogas plants in four states as part of its efforts to expand business beyond natural gas and embrace cleaner forms of energy. The firm has signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with two technology partners to set up compressed biogas plants in Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, it said. The MoUs were signed during the India Energy Week 2024 here. \"Additionally, IGL has already empanelled two other partners for the same purpose,\" the firm said. \"The biogas produced from these 19 plants shall be fed into IGL's city gas distribution network\". IGL retails CNG and piped natural gas in the national capital and adjoining cities. India, which imports more than 85 per cent of its crude oil requirement, is stepping up efforts to explore new forms of energy to clean up the skies and reduce dependence on imported fuels. The government has mandated 1 per cent blending of Compressed BioGas (CBG) in domestic natural gas and piped natural gas from April 2025, and this will be raised gradually to 5 per cent from 2028-29. The CBG blending obligation is aimed at promoting production and consumption of compressed biogas in the country. It is likely to lead to an establishment of 750 compressed biogas projects across the country by 2028-29. A central repository body will monitor and implement the blending mandate based on operational guidelines. IGL said the MoUs were signed in the presence of K K Chatiwal, Managing Director of IGL, Pawan Kumar, Director (Commercial) of IGL and other officials. \"This partnership aims to produce 0.45 million standard cubic meters per day of biogas from waste, equivalent to approximately 5 per cent of IGL's daily requirements,\" IGL said. The MoUs promise to be a win-win situation for stakeholders like municipal authorities, City Gas Distribution (CGD) entities, farmers and the public at large. While municipal authorities will get rid of municipal waste, farmers will be able to dispose of agricultural waste, CGD entities will get cheaper gas and public shall get clean environment, it said.",

    "content": "Essar Oil and Gas Exploration \u0026 Production Ltd is speeding up capital expenditure plans to explore and produce unconventional hydrocarbons that will help raise gas output at its flagship block to about 5 million standard cubic meters per day from less than 1 mmscmd now, its CEO said. EOGEPL is India's largest producer of Coal-Bed Methane (CBM) which just like conventional gas can be used as CNG in automobiles or as feedstock in industries. Buoyed by investor-friendly upstream policy reforms in recent years, including providing marketing and pricing freedom for CBM, the firm is drilling more wells, including horizontal ones, that will help tap into wider resources lying below coal seam in its Raniganj East block in West Bengal, EOGEPL CEO Pankaj Kalra told reporters on the sidelines of the India Energy Week. EOGEPL was carved out by the owners of Essar Group after promoters sold Essar Oil -- which mainly comprised downstream oil refinery and fuel retailing operations -- to a consortium of Rosneft, Trafigura and United Capital Partners at USD 12.9 billion. The firm's drilling campaign has primarily focused on 120 square kilometers out of the 500 sq km block it has. To tap into untouched areas so far, the firm plans to drill well vertically down from the earth surface and then after reaching a certain depth, go horizontal for about 1 km or so. Multiple such wells are planned which would help tap a wider area, he said. \"We hope to hit 5 mmscmd production in 3-4 years and this peak output can be sustained for 7-8 years.\" Horizontal wells are five times more efficient than vertical ones and have been a reason for substantial production of CBM gas in Australia and China. The company, which has already invested around Rs 5,000 crore in developing the Raniganj block, is looking to invest another Rs 2,000 crore.The block also has shale gas reserves and the firm is currently studying the potential, he said. While the block has in place reserves of 4 trillion cubic feet of CBM, shale gas could be double of that. But the recovery factor in shale gas is low compared to CBM, he said. The firm is looking to explore shale gas reserves after the government overhauled its exploration policy, allowing operators freedom to explore both conventional and non-conventional sources such as CBM and shale reserves within exploration acreage. Increased production of CBM as well as shale gas will help contribute to India's vision of becoming a gas-based economy that aims at raising the share of gas in the energy mix to 15 per cent by 2030 from current 6.2 per cent. Kalra said the company in the initial campaign drilled more than 350 wells and an additional 200 wells are in the pipeline to boost production.",

Blue Ocean means a new, uncontested market.'Blue Ocean' opportunity for startups building for rural India's top 30% market: Accel's Anand DanielRelated stories",
    "content": "The top 30 per cent of rural households in India will show an annual spend of approximately USD 540 billion by 2030, says Anand Daniel, partner at global VC fund Accel, about the increasingly aspirational segment that accounts for 52 per cent of rural consumption. \"There is a Blue Ocean opportunity for startups building for rural Bharat's top 30 per cent - there is immense potential for growth and innovation in this segment, which has yet to be fully explored,\" Daniel told PTI, citing the massive runway for business models with a \"Bharat\" focus. Blue Ocean means a new, uncontested market. Internet penetration in rural India, which is getting modernised in terms of both digital and physical infrastructure, reaches 350 million users and 82 per cent of villages, he noted. Excerpts from the interview: Q: What makes you bullish on the Bharat opportunity? A: While there is talk of a slowdown in rural India as evidenced by slower volume growth in FMCG, increased demand for work under MGNREGA and weak two-wheeler sales, these data points don't show us what's happening with the top 30 per cent of rural households. By 2030, the top 30 per cent of households will show an annual spend of approximately USD 540 billion. We know that rural India overall is a large consumer market with about USD 500 billion of annual consumption expenditure from over 915 million people. This is two-thirds of India's population. Interestingly, this rural spend is highly concentrated, with 52 per cent rural consumption coming from the top 30 per cent households. Till now, we have seen the success stories of the Indian startup ecosystem or category leaders largely built on catering to the needs of the urban Indian consumer. Given the surface area of the rural Bharat opportunity, we are optimistic that the next wave of disruption will come from daring builders catering to the needs of that top 30 per cent which is an increasingly aspirational rural India. Large public companies across sectors such as FMCG, auto, and fintech are already catering to some needs of rural India and capitalising on this opportunity. There are 10 large public companies making nearly 49 per cent (USD 35 billion-plus) revenue from rural, and each of them adopted a rural-first business model to cater to this segment. We are now seeing the emergence of startups with Bharat-focused business models. More than 50 such startups that are building for Bharat had raised USD 6.7 billion in funding by early 2023. Q: Are there specific sectors that are more promising? Where will we see faster growth in the next three-five years? A: Category wise, rural and urban consumers spend on similar things. However, while urban top 30 per cent spend twice as much on non-food segments (69 per cent) as food, the rural top 30 per cent of consumers spend equal amounts across food and non-food segments. This is pretty eye-opening - in the top 30 per cent rural households, 12 categories (five food, seven non-food) have an annual spend of USD 10 billion plus each, showing us many investable opportunities. Currently, we are excited about areas like commerce and healthcare for Bharat. Education and entertainment are the other two that seem very promising. In commerce, we are observing different models emerge -- kirana-led commerce, village-level entrepreneur-led commerce, rural house of brands -- across sub-categories such as fresh fruit and vegetables, grocery, lifestyle products, beauty and personal care and electronics. We have already invested in two grocery business models for T2/T3 cities and towns with Apnamart and Citymall, and are now looking for similar solutions in rural areas as well. In healthcare, we are seeing solutions being built around remote clinics, digitisation of pharmacies, generic medicines and secondary and tertiary care. There are several reasons for this trend playing out now. First, rural India is getting modernised in terms of both digital and physical infrastructure-internet penetration is high, reaching 350 million users, and 82 per cent of villages are now reachable by road. Second, rural consumers are getting exposed to urban brands and products via online content consumption through social media and Over the Top (OTT) platforms, which indicates that e-commerce adoption in rural India is expected to follow the e-commerce boom in tier-3 cities. Q: What are some of the key challenges that founders can face when building for rural India? A: Building for rural consumers can be tricky - consumers are widespread geographically,which means that population density is low, plus the average revenue one can earn per rural customer will be lower than that of an urban customer. So, founders need to solve for aspects like distribution costs and cost-effective customer acquisition. When it comes to distribution costs, supply chain optimisation should be an area of focus for founders while maintaining viable unit economics. With regard to cost-effective customer acquisition, founders need to have a very sharp focus on selecting their customer and high-value economic clusters (a top 30 percentile rural consumer spend similar to an average urban consumer that is nearly USD 1,000 annual per capita expenditure). There also tends to be a lack of in-depth understanding of the rural consumer. This is a high-trust community that is aspirational and time-rich. Founders need to stay customer-obsessed, and learn the nuances of this audience to fully grasp the painpoints of this target group. There is a Blue Ocean opportunity for startups building for rural Bharat's top 30 per cent -- there is immense potential for growth and innovation in this segment, which has yet to be fully explored. Q: What's your investment approach/philosophy? How has it changed over the past decade in India? A: On average, a bulk of our portfolio returns come from just a handful of investments. This is essentially the \"power law\" at work in the venture capital industry. So our investment approach is to find these outlier companies and back them as early in their journey as possible. A few such outlier examples from Accel's portfolio in India would be Flipkart, Freshworks andSwiggy - all of these were our early-stage bets. We believe in Accel's \"prepared mind\" approach to investing- this is a thesis-based method of investing wherein you research a space and know what large problem needs to be solved and then look for the best team building a solution for that problem.",

    "content": "Tata Steel CEO and Managing Director T V Narendran claimed India is the fastest growing economy of the world and the next three decades are important for the country on the development front. China has emerged rapidly during the last 30-40 years and the next 30 years are important for India, which is the fastest growing economy of the world, Narendran said while addressing the members of Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) here on Tuesday evening. \"Currently, China is the largest steel-producing country in the world and we are second. In view of the global challenges being faced by the steel sector, we have to move forward keeping in mind the steel prices\", the Tata Steel MD said. As Tata Steel's Jamshedpur plant is located in a densely populated area, there was no possibility of further expansion of the Jamshedpur plant, Narendran said. He said Tata Steel's relation with SCCI was strengthening continuously and this would help further industrial growth. Hailing the sacrifices made by workers in the growth of the company, Narendran said Tata Steel is a \"multi-generation company\" and the cordial relationship between Tata Steel and Tata Workers Union led the company to march forward even though \"we have to work amidst the different ambience of the prevailing world scenario\". Dwelling on the MSME sector here, he said these units are the backbone of big industries, which rely on the quality products of MSME. Tata Steel is a big company and its backbone is also the MSME units, he admitted. Jamshedpur is an important place as far as MSMEs were concerned, Narendran said. In his welcome address, SCCI president Vijay Anand Moonka lauded the performance of Tata Steel, which was growing continuously under the dynamic leadership of Narendran. Moonka said Tata Steel should come forward for development of an airport in the vicinity of Jamshedpur.",

The 28 percent GST on player deposits in real money games (RMG) has led to an increase in the tax burdenRelated stories",
    "content": "Metaverse and gaming tech company OneVerse have planned to acquire over a dozen companies in the gaming sector which is currently reeling under the goods and services tax (GST) pressure. The 28 percent GST on player deposits in real money games (RMG) has led to an increase in the tax burden resulting in companies shutting down and other firms slashing employee strength to stay afloat. Some of the companies that are hit by GST pressure are part of the acquisition portfolio of OneVerse which, in total, will acquire 13 gaming firms by the end of this year, said the company's founder, Prashanth Joshua. Joshua added that GST changes have put pressure on the profitability of RMG companies and consolidation will help mitigate the pressure. \"Gaming companies spend 20 percent of their revenue as operational cost which include marketing, salaries, technology cost, among others. By consolidating 7-8 companies we will save at least 15 percent of the companies' expenses. We are able to offset the negative impact of GST and as a larger company we are able to access larger capital pool in terms of investor growth funds. We can grow faster as a portfolio company than an individual firm. There will be a lot of consolidation at an operating level with cost efficiencies that will build in,\" he said. The company has earmarked $120 million for the first phase of acquisitions which include eight firms. \"We are expanding our pool to accommodate rest of the companies. We have founders capital and family offices that are backing us for these acquisitions,\" said Joshua. Consolidation is the way forward in the gaming sector, said Paul Micheal, CEO of OneVerse Gaming. \"We saw a lot of small gaming cos mushrooming both pre and post-pandemic. I realised that for this industry the time has come for consolidation even before the GST change because of too much of competition and companies not knowing the system that would have killed the market. Hence, I pushed the narrative and spoke to these companies that we are acquiring.\" Micheal said that as a larger gaming company, they will be able to offer better technology to users, and higher rewards which will lead to more player retention. \"We will have the scale (after the acquisitions) because of which we will be able to offer higher bonuses and rewards to players which other companies are unable to do so today. We have identified companies with healthy unit economics and the companies we have acquired are profitable,\" Joshua said. The company, which has been building metaverse relations based on virtual reality experiences on the Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro for sectors including real estate and healthcare, among others, will expand its reach to gaming. \"We will have gamers experiencing gaming on Apple Vision Pro. We have a head start of two years in offering these experiences versus other companies. We will start going live on metaverse and start deploying immersive experience for our customers (in gaming) and we will be able to give to customers better technology,\" said Joshua, adding that OneVerse's gaming business is profitable. \"It looks like gaming could become the largest portfolio (for Oneverse) after the acquisition deals close,\" the founder noted.",

Armed with a substantially lighter balance sheet after it repaid Rs 1,40,000 crore of loans over the last four years, the group now has a strong revenue stream of over Rs 1 lakh crore from existing businesses. \"Essar is charting its path to a resurgence by investing in ecosystems for sustainable growth in India and beyond,\" Prashant Ruia, Director at Essar Capital, said at India Energy Week here. \"As India emerges as the world's fastest-growing and third-largest economy, Essar is dedicated to fulfilling climate commitments and promoting green growth,\" he said. Essar will invest USD 3.6 billion to build one of the world's largest low-carbon (blue hydrogen) plants and the world's first green refinery, he said without giving further details. It is also looking to develop a 1 gigawatt green hydrogen project in Gujarat. In the realm of green mobility solutions, Essar is focused on building an LNG and electric ecosystem to decarbonise long-haul heavy trucks, contributing to a cleaner transportation sector, he said. Besides, the group is also producing gas using coal seams from a block in West Bengal, he said. Its arm, Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Limited (EOGEPL), India's leader in the coal bed methane industry, contributes nearly 65 per cent of the country's total coal bed methane production and aims to increase its contribution to India's total gas production to 5 per cent within the next five years, he said. Ruia did not share the investment details in green mobility and hydrogen plants. \"With these initiatives, Essar is at the forefront of driving the nation's vision of energy transition and sustainable growth,\" he said. Separately, in a post on X, Ruia said: \"Excited to be back at the @IndiaEnergyWeek, where impactful dialogues are shaping a sustainable future. Hon'ble PM @narendramodi ji's vision for India's economic ascent and journey towards becoming the world's third-largest economy is truly inspiring. Privileged to be part of the round table chaired by the PM. His insightful vision is bound to get the global leaders to invest in the massive opportunity in #energytransition that India offers.\" Essar had over the years invested Rs 2 lakh crore in sectors ranging from ports to steel plants, oil refining and fuel retailing, power generation, mining, shipping and telecom. It sold its oil refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat and fuel retailing network to Russia's Rosneft-led consortium in an over Rs 86,000 crore deal (USD 13 billion), which was the largest FDI in the sector. Its steel plant was sold to ArcelorMittal-led group in insolvency proceedings. Essar currently owns businesses in the core sectors of energy, metals and mining, infrastructure, services and technology. In the energy sector, it has commercial interests in oil, gas and coal bed methane exploration and production in India, Vietnam and Nigeria, oil refining and retailing in the UK and power generation in India and Canada. The group's aggregate revenues now stand at about USD 15 billion. Its businesses include a 10 million tonnes per annum oil refinery in the UK, 12 trillion cubic feet reserves (including some producing fields) of unconventional hydrocarbons in India, an iron ore mine and pellet project in the US, and a high-grade thermal coal mine with 72 million tonnes of proven reserves in Indonesia, among others.

The Danish holding company bought a minority stake with Abu Dhabi sovereign investor Mubadala and California's top public pension system, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), according to a Manipal statement dated Feb. 2. For Novo Holdings, which invests in life science companies and had assets of 108 billion euros ($115.86 billion) at end-2022, it was its largest investment in Asia to date. Its key markets in the region are India, South-East Asia and China, where it opened an office in Shanghai last year. Manipal Hospitals has 33 hospitals across India, the world's most populous country, with around 6 million patients annually, Novo Holdings said. \"A rising middle class, paired with an increased appreciation for advanced medical facilities and quality healthcare services, has driven an uptick in demand for private hospital care in the country,\" it said. \"Other factors include the expansion of health insurance coverage and the sophistication of medical technology adopted at private institutions.\" INDIA HEALTHCARE BOOM The Indian healthcare market is expected to grow near three-fold over eight years to $458 billion by 2030, according to forecasts by global consulting firms Boston Consulting Group and B Capital. Prabhudas Lilladher analyst Param Desai said he expects to see more foreign investment. \"There is a genuine need for more healthcare infrastructure in India be it in terms of beds, hospitals, doctors, so all of these are attracting investments,\" he said. Novo Holdings, which is owned by Novo Nordisk Foundation, has 77% of voting shares in Novo Nordisk, the maker of blockbuster obesity drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. A top official at Novo Nordisk told Reuters in September the drugmaker aims to bring Wegovy to India, where obesity rates are high especially among women, in 2026, after securing regulatory approvals and ensuring it has enough supply to meet demand. On Monday, it announced it was buying Catalent (CTLT.N), opens new tab, a manufacturing subcontractor for the weight-loss drug, for $16.5 billion to help Novo Nordisk meet soaring demand. The drugmaker expects the deal to boost Wegovy output from 2026.",

    "content": "Jindal Power, a unit of India's Jindal Steel \u0026 Power Ltd, has submitted a 140 billion rupees ($1.69 billion)bid for a coal-based power plant in the eastern region, two sources familiar with the development told Reuters. The company has submitted a financial bid for the KSK Mahanadi plant that is in insolvency proceedings, and which is being eyed by billionaire Gautam Adani's Adani Power and Anil Agarwal's Vedanta Ltd among others, a source aware of the matter said. The 1,800-megawatt power plant, built by KSK Energy Ventures, is one of many distressed coal-fired private power stations mired in insolvency proceedings in recent years as owners did not have fuel supplies and the funds to complete them. The plant has cash reserves of 120 billion rupees ($1.45 billion) from operations, and total debt claims of 320 billion rupees ($3.85 billion). \"Jindal Power has submitted an unsolicited bid to the authorised resolution professional for KSK Mahanadi Power project in Chhattisgarh,\" one of the sources, who works for the government said. The sources did not want to be quoted as they were not authorised to speak to media. A Jindal Power spokesperson declined to comment. Sumit Binani- the resolution professional appointed for the KSK Mahanadi power project by the insolvency court - did not respond immediately to queries sent by Reuters. The unsolicited bid shows Indian private companies' renewed interest in coal-based power plants.
