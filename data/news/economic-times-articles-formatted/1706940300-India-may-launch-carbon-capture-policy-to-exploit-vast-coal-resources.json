The policy, set to be unveiled later this year, will provide incentives for companies to trap, recycle, and store their emissions underground. The power sector, responsible for 42% of India's emissions, can potentially capture and recycle 70% of its emissions through carbon capture. India aims to use coal in a sustainable way and is exploring coal gasification technology as well, which has marginally lower emissions compared to conventional coal firing.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-02-03T11:35:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-02-05T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
