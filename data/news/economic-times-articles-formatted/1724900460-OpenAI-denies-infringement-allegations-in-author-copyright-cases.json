The company argues that it employs fair use of copyrighted material to create new, original content with its chatbot ChatGPT.","content":"OpenAI has responded in California federal court to allegations that it misused the work of authors including Michael Chabon, Ta-Nehisi Coates and comedian Sarah Silverman to train its artificial-intelligence language model. The Microsoft-backed AI company said in an answer to the complaints on Tuesday that it makes fair use of copyrighted content to teach models like the one underlying its popular chatbot ChatGPT to create original material. \"The models learn, as we all do, from what has come before,\" OpenAI said in its filing. \"The fair use defense exists for precisely that reason: to encourage and allow the development of new ideas that build on earlier ones.\" Attorneys for the authors and attorneys and spokespeople for OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the filing on Wednesday. Copyright owners including writers, news outlets and music publishers have filed several high-stakes lawsuits against tech companies over the alleged exploitation of their work without permission in order to train text-based generative AI systems. The group of authors that includes Silverman, Coates and Chabon filed separate lawsuits against Meta Platforms and Microsoft-backed OpenAI over their systems last year.","cleaned_content":"openai has responded in california federal court to allegations that it misused the work of authors including michael chabon ta nehisi coates and comedian sarah silverman to train its artificial intelligence language model the microsoft backed ai company said in an answer to the complaints on tuesday that it makes fair use of copyrighted content to teach models like the one underlying its popular chatbot chatgpt to create original material the models learn as we all do from what has come before openai said in its filing the fair use defense exists for precisely that reason to encourage and allow the development of new ideas that build on earlier ones attorneys for the authors and attorneys and spokespeople for openai did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the filing on wednesday copyright owners including writers news outlets and music publishers have filed several high stakes lawsuits against tech companies over the alleged exploitation of their work without permission in order to train text based generative ai systems the group of authors that includes silverman coates and chabon filed separate lawsuits against meta platforms and microsoft backed openai over their systems last year","timestamp":"2024-08-29T08:31:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-08-29T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
