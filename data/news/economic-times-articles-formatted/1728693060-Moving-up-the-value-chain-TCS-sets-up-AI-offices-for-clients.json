These offices provide technical infrastructure, frameworks, and guardrails to ensure the successful implementation of AI solutions.","content":"IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has been bagging contracts for setting up AI (artificial intelligence) offices for clients, with deal sizes in the $10 million to $30 million range, a top executive said at a recent earnings call.K Krithivasan, chief executive officer and managing director, said at the company’s Q2 earnings call that many of the GenAI (generative AI) engagements tend to be small, “but we do also get some large projects”.Citing an example, he said TCS established an AI office which was a program that checks the overall architecture, (fills the) guardrails, ensures the risk and regulatory (legal) frameworks, looks at all potential POCs (proofs of concept), and evaluates the POCs and does other related things.“Such projects will be more long tenured and value could be higher. If you are doing one single POC or one single program, the value mayn’t be very high. But where it is a long-term project, the value could be high”, Krithivasan said.“These AI offices try to create an overall infrastructure. It's both the technical infrastructure as well as the framework and guardrail that we require”, he said, adding that for such projects, the deal value varies based on the tenure of the deal and the size of the organisation, and could range between $10 million to $30 million.","cleaned_content":"it major tata consultancy services tcs has been bagging contracts for setting up ai artificial intelligence offices for clients with deal sizes in the \u003cONE_TEN\u003e million to \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e million range a top executive said at a recent earnings call k krithivasan chief executive officer and managing director said at the company s q2 earnings call that many of the genai generative ai engagements tend to be small but we do also get some large projects citing an example he said tcs established an ai office which was a program that checks the overall architecture fills the guardrails ensures the risk and regulatory legal frameworks looks at all potential pocs proofs of concept and evaluates the pocs and does other related things such projects will be more long tenured and value could be higher if you are doing one single poc or one single program the value mayn t be very high but where it is a long term project the value could be high krithivasan said these ai offices try to create an overall infrastructure its both the technical infrastructure as well as the framework and guardrail that we require he said adding that for such projects the deal value varies based on the tenure of the deal and the size of the organisation and could range between \u003cONE_TEN\u003e million to \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e million","timestamp":"2024-10-12T06:01:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-14T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
