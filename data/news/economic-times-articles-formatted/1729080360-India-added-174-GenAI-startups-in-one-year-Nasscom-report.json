This growth has been driven by the launch of 17 native GenAI language models (a 4.6X increase in GenAI services) and a significant rise in the number of startups offering GenAI assistants, which comprise nearly 80% of the newly added startups over the past year.Rajesh Nambiar, incoming president of Nasscom, said, “Looking at India’s GDP growth, it has to be led by technology. The tech sector alone is expected to contribute roughly a trillion dollars to GDP.” He added that deep-tech startups are on the rise, with India now home to over 3,600 deep-tech startups, 74% of which focus on AI-driven solutions.Commenting on revenue generation, the report noted, “75% of startups in the first half of calendar year (CY) 2024 were generating revenue – a significant jump from 22% in the first half of CY2023.” India now ranks 6th globally in the share of GenAI startup ecosystems among major economies.“Bengaluru remains the leading GenAI startup hub in India, housing 43% of all startups,” the report added. It also pointed to emerging hubs, with cities like Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Surat, and Kolkata growing quickly and now representing 18% of the startup ecosystem.","cleaned_content":"india s total number of generative ai genai startups surged \u003cTHREE_\u003e times from over \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e in the first half of calendar year \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e to more than \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e by the first half of \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e according to a nasscom report titled indias generative ai startup landscape \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e released in bengaluru on wednesday the report highlighted that despite being in an early stage india s genai startups have attracted over \u003cSEVEN_HUNDRED\u003e million in cumulative funding since \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e this growth has been driven by the launch of \u003cONE_TEN\u003e native genai language models a \u003cFOUR_\u003e x increase in genai services and a significant rise in the number of startups offering genai assistants which comprise nearly \u003cEIGHT_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of the newly added startups over the past year rajesh nambiar incoming president of nasscom said looking at india s gdp growth it has to be led by technology the tech sector alone is expected to contribute roughly a trillion dollars to gdp he added that deep tech startups are on the rise with india now home to over \u003cTHREE_THOUSAND\u003e deep tech startups \u003cSEVEN_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of which focus on ai driven solutions commenting on revenue generation the report noted \u003cSEVEN_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of startups in the first half of calendar year cy \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e were generating revenue a significant jump from \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in the first half of cy2023 india now ranks \u003cSIX_\u003e th globally in the share of genai startup ecosystems among major economies bengaluru remains the leading genai startup hub in india housing \u003cFOUR_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of all startups the report added it also pointed to emerging hubs with cities like ahmedabad lucknow surat and kolkata growing quickly and now representing \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of the startup ecosystem","timestamp":"2024-10-16T17:36:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-17T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
