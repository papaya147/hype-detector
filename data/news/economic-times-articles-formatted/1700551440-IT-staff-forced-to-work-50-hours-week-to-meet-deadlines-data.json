The people cost to revenue productivity ratio of 1:1.8 remaining flat despite revenue growth shows an equivalent growth of people costs.","cleaned_content":"infosys founder narayana murthy may have incited a nationwide debate by saying that indians should work \u003cSEVEN_TEN\u003e hours every week but data sourced by et show that employees in the country s software companies are putting in longer hours than the industry standard it employees in the country work on an average work for around \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e hours per week translating around \u003cONE_TEN\u003e hours a day in the \u003cFIVE_\u003e day week while the standard is \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e hours a week as a large part of them is often compelled to work longer hours to meet project deadlines as per data from staffing firms experts believe the industrys emphasis on counting hours worked rather than measuring productivity lengthy commutes infrastructural challenges and work related stress also hinder employee productivity in india over the past five fiscal years the productivity per rupee spent on compensation to each employee has remained stagnant as per xpheno data for all quarters since amj april may june \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e pandemic quarter for every re \u003cONE_\u003e spent on talent cost the revenue return has remained stagnant at rs \u003cONE_\u003e \u003cONE_\u003e the people cost to revenue productivity ratio of \u003cONE_\u003e \u003cONE_\u003e remaining flat despite revenue growth shows an equivalent growth of people costs","timestamp":"2023-11-21T12:54:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2023-11-21T12:54:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
