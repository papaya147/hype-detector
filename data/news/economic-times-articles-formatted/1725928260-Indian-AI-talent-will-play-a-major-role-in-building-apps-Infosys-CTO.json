Additionally, AI is being used for migration and modernisation of existing solutions. Internally, Infosys is seeing productivity benefits for employees in software engineering improve 10-30%, Infosys chief technology officer Mohammed Rafee Tarafdar said.","content":"India’s engineering and artificial intelligence talent will play a significant role in the huge volume game of building software applications, Infosys chief technology officer Mohammed Rafee Tarafdar said. Enterprise problems can be solved by creating more use cases, by getting deeper into the technology stack to bring swiftness and higher scale for impact, he said.Speaking with ET, Tarafdar said Infosys, India’s second largest homegrown technology services company, is building specialised model solutions by embedding generative AI and AI into its large deals.Large contracts, typically $500 million and above, are a key revenue driver for technology outsourcing companies.“In large deals, we are using GenAI to quickly understand the current operations of our customers, business processes and the tech to become productive in transitioning and then becoming operational. We are also doing a lot of model innovation, not just limiting to use cases but also creating a lot of specialised, fine-tuned models to help us deliver our services better and these are IPs (internet protocols) specific to us, helping us differentiate and deliver better,” Tarafdar said.According to him, the impact of the ongoing pilots will be visible only after the next 6-12 months. He said, “We will have to reach a number … For them to go full out in production and scale, I think will take around 6 to 12 months, when some of these outcomes will be more available.”","cleaned_content":"india s engineering and artificial intelligence talent will play a significant role in the huge volume game of building software applications infosys chief technology officer mohammed rafee tarafdar said enterprise problems can be solved by creating more use cases by getting deeper into the technology stack to bring swiftness and higher scale for impact he said speaking with et tarafdar said infosys india s second largest homegrown technology services company is building specialised model solutions by embedding generative ai and ai into its large deals large contracts typically \u003cFIVE_HUNDRED\u003e million and above are a key revenue driver for technology outsourcing companies in large deals we are using genai to quickly understand the current operations of our customers business processes and the tech to become productive in transitioning and then becoming operational we are also doing a lot of model innovation not just limiting to use cases but also creating a lot of specialised fine tuned models to help us deliver our services better and these are ips internet protocols specific to us helping us differentiate and deliver better tarafdar said according to him the impact of the ongoing pilots will be visible only after the next \u003cSIX_\u003e \u003cONE_TEN\u003e months he said we will have to reach a number for them to go full out in production and scale i think will take around \u003cSIX_\u003e to \u003cONE_TEN\u003e months when some of these outcomes will be more available","timestamp":"2024-09-10T06:01:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-10T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
