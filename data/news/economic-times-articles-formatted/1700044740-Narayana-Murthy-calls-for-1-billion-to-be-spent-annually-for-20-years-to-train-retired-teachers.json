Murthy was addressing the Infosys Science Foundation (ISF), where the winners of the Infosys Prize 2023 were announced.According to the Infosys cofounder, the teacher training programme should be a year-long affair, where about US$ 100,000 is paid to the retired teachers, who can themselves become trainers over five years.This means the 20-year programme would cost India $1 billion a year and $20 billion over 20 years.“Our nation, targeting a GDP of $5 trillion soon, will not find it a big financial burden,” said Murthy. Quoting Derek Bok, a former President of Harvard University, he added, “If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.”","cleaned_content":"infosys founder nr narayana murthy has called for a yearly investment of at least \u003cONE_\u003e billion for the next \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e years on training primary and secondary school teachers to push implementation of the national education policy nep one possible way of accelerating nep s outcome is to invite \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e retired highly accomplished teachers from the developed world and from india in stem areas science technology engineering and mathematics to create \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e train the teacher colleges in our \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e states and \u003cEIGHT_\u003e union territories he said murthy was addressing the infosys science foundation isf where the winners of the infosys prize \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e were announced according to the infosys cofounder the teacher training programme should be a year long affair where about us \u003cONE_HUNDRED_THOUSAND\u003e is paid to the retired teachers who can themselves become trainers over five years this means the \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e year programme would cost india \u003cONE_\u003e billion a year and \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e billion over \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e years our nation targeting a gdp of \u003cFIVE_\u003e trillion soon will not find it a big financial burden said murthy quoting derek bok a former president of harvard university he added if you think education is expensive try ignorance","timestamp":"2023-11-15T16:09:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2023-11-16T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
