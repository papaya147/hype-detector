The official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), speaking on condition of anonymity, made the comment in a briefing to reporters on the alleged use of AI by Russia and other countries to influence the Nov. 5 vote. AI content produced by Moscow is \"consistent with Russia's broader efforts to boost the former president's (Trump) candidacy and denigrate the vice president (Harris) and the Democratic Party, including through conspiratorial narratives,\" he said. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia previously has denied interfering in the U.S. election. Like other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI learns from past data how to take actions. Using that training, it creates new content like text, pictures and videos that appears to have been produced by humans.","cleaned_content":"russia has generated more ai content to influence the u s presidential election than any other foreign power as part of its broader effort to boost republican candidate donald trump over democrat kamala harris a u s intelligence official said on monday the official from the office of the director of national intelligence odni speaking on condition of anonymity made the comment in a briefing to reporters on the alleged use of ai by russia and other countries to influence the nov \u003cFIVE_\u003e vote ai content produced by moscow is consistent with russias broader efforts to boost the former presidents trump candidacy and denigrate the vice president harris and the democratic party including through conspiratorial narratives he said the russian embassy in washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment russia previously has denied interfering in the u s election like other forms of artificial intelligence generative ai learns from past data how to take actions using that training it creates new content like text pictures and videos that appears to have been produced by humans","timestamp":"2024-09-24T07:53:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-24T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
