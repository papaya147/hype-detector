Last week, he did a town hall in London, a geography on the other side of the Atlantic -- where he has been focussed till recently as CEO of Americas 1. Pallia was elevated as CEO of Wipro, after Thierry Delaporte's sudden exit from the firm 15 months before the expiry of his term. Wipro's HR head Saurabh Govil emailed employees on Monday that the CEO will interact every quarter with senior employees, as part of quarterly CEO leadership connect, ET has learnt. Govil also mentioned about \"quarterly townhalls and Q\u0026A opportunities.\" Organisationally, Pallia has also hand-picked two Wipro veterans as key senior leaders (Malay Joshi, CEO of Americas 1 and Hari Shetty as Chief Strategist and sales excellence officer). Joshi succeeded Pallia as CEO of Americas 1 - the company's strategic market unit (SMU) that has been outperforming other SMUs for past couple of quarters. Similarly, the IT major also elevated Hari Shetty as its Chief Strategist and Sales Excellence Officer. Shetty has been with Wipro for 31 years and led the technology platform, products, and gaming business division before the appointment.While few employees were awed by Pallia's passion for Wipro even after 32 years at the firm, some analysts believe that the new CEO will not make any radical change in the strategy and organisation and will continue the transformation work that was left by his predecessor Delaporte.
