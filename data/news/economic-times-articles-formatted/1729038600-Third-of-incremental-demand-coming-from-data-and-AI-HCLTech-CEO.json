Speaking to ET, CEO and managing director C Vijayakumar declined to elaborate on revenues earned from data and AI businesses. “It (data and AI revenues) is spread across different verticals, and every client situation is different, so I'm not able to quantify it. But I think at least a third of the (incremental) demand seems to be coming from AI and data, roughly,” he said.Announcing the September quarter results on Monday, the Noida-based company reported revenue of Rs 28,862 crore, up 6.7% from a year ago and 2.6% sequentially. Revenue surpassed the Rs 28,710 crore ET estimate for Q2. The company also raised its lower-end guidance for revenue growth to 3.5-5.0% from the earlier 3.0-5.0% for FY25.“To grow at 3.5%, we need to grow, maybe 0% for Q3 and Q4, and to grow at 5%, we have to grow at 2% in Q3 and Q4; that's the math on the demand environment,” Vijayakumar said in a post-earnings call.“We see good demand in financial services, that's also extending to other verticals. But we are a little cautious about extrapolating this for a longer period of time. We are going to take it one quarter at a time…We believe in the mid-to-long term, of course, the levers are sustainable, but quarter to quarter, there can always be variations,” he said.","cleaned_content":"hcltech garnered about a third of incremental demand from data and artificial intelligence ai verticals helping india s third largest software services provider post better than expected revenue \u003cSIX_PERCENT\u003e higher from a year earlier in the fiscal second quarter speaking to et ceo and managing director c vijayakumar declined to elaborate on revenues earned from data and ai businesses it data and ai revenues is spread across different verticals and every client situation is different so im not able to quantify it but i think at least a third of the incremental demand seems to be coming from ai and data roughly he said announcing the september quarter results on monday the noida based company reported revenue of rs \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore up \u003cSIX_PERCENT\u003e from a year ago and \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e sequentially revenue surpassed the rs \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore et estimate for q2 the company also raised its lower end guidance for revenue growth to \u003cTHREE_\u003e \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e from the earlier \u003cTHREE_\u003e \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e for fy25 to grow at \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e we need to grow maybe \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e for q3 and q4 and to grow at \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e we have to grow at \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e in q3 and q4 thats the math on the demand environment vijayakumar said in a post earnings call we see good demand in financial services thats also extending to other verticals but we are a little cautious about extrapolating this for a longer period of time we are going to take it one quarter at a time we believe in the mid to long term of course the levers are sustainable but quarter to quarter there can always be variations he said","timestamp":"2024-10-16T06:00:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-16T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
