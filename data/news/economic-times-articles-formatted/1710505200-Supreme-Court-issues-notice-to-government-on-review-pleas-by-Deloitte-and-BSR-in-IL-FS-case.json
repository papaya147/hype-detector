It further stated that its only three partners and a total team of 18 persons were involved in the IFIN audit and any default on their part cannot result in action against the entire firm, which has approximately 150 partners and employs around 4500 persons.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-03-15T17:50:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-03-18T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
