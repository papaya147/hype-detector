Nvidia's stock has driven significant gains in the S\u0026P 500 this year, and traders are betting on a large potential rally due to its dominance in artificial intelligence chips.","content":"Traders in the U.S. equity options market are expecting Nvidia's upcoming earnings report to spark a more than $300 billion swing in the shares of the world's most dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker. Options pricing shows that traders anticipate a move of around 9.8% in the company's shares on Thursday, a day after it reports earnings, data from analytics firm ORATS showed. That's larger than the expected move ahead of any Nvidia report over the last three years and well above the stock's average post-earnings move of 8.1% over that same period, according to ORATS.  Given Nvidia's market capitalization of about $3.11 trillion, a 9.8% swing in the shares would translate to about $305 billion, likely the largest expected earnings move for any company in history, analysts said.  Such a move would dwarf the market capitalization of 95% of S\u0026P 500 constituents, including Netflix and Merck, according to LSEG data. The results from Nvidia, whose chips are widely seen as the gold standard in artificial intelligence, also have big implications for the broader market. The stock is up some 150% year-to-date, accounting for around a quarter of the S\u0026P 500's 18% year-to-date gain.
