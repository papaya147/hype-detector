San Francisco-based Discord and the regulator, Roskomnadzor, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Roskomnadzor is demanding the removal of 947 illegal materials, TASS cited Roskomnadzor as saying, including posts \"containing child pornography, calls for extremism, the involvement of minors in illegal activity, calls for suicide, LGBT propaganda, and pro-drug content\".  Russia has for several years ordered foreign technology platforms to remove content it regards as illegal, issuing relatively small, but regular fines when it sees failures to comply. Moscow last year widened restrictions on the promotion of what it calls \"LGBT propaganda\" amid a broader crackdown on LGBT rights, amid a push by President Vladimir Putin to promote what he calls traditional values.
