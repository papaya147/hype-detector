The operation, identified as Storm-2035, used ChatGPT to generate content focused on topics such as commentary on the candidates on both sides in the U.S. elections, the conflict in Gaza and Israel's presence at the Olympic Games and then shared it via social media accounts and websites.  Investigation by the Microsoft-backed AI company showed that ChatGPT was used for generating long-form articles and shorter social media comments.  OpenAI said the operation did not appear to have achieved meaningful audience engagement.  Majority of the identified social media posts received few or no likes, shares or comments and the company did not see indications of web articles being shared across social media.","cleaned_content":"openai said on friday it had taken down accounts of an iranian group for using its chatgpt chatbot to generate content meant for influencing the u s presidential election and other issues the operation identified as storm \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e used chatgpt to generate content focused on topics such as commentary on the candidates on both sides in the u s elections the conflict in gaza and israels presence at the olympic games and then shared it via social media accounts and websites investigation by the microsoft backed ai company showed that chatgpt was used for generating long form articles and shorter social media comments openai said the operation did not appear to have achieved meaningful audience engagement majority of the identified social media posts received few or no likes shares or comments and the company did not see indications of web articles being shared across social media","timestamp":"2024-08-17T08:49:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-08-19T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
