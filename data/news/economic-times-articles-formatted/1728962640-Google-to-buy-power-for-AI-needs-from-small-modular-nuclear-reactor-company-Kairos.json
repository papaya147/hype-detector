Kairos aims to bring the first SMR online by 2030, despite permitting and cost challenges.","content":"Alphabet's Google said on Monday it signed the world's first corporate agreement to buy power from multiple small modular reactors to meet electricity demand for artificial intelligence. The technology company's agreement with Kairos Power aims to bring Kairos' first small modular reactor online by 2030, followed by additional deployments through 2035. The companies did not reveal financial details of the agreement or where in the U.S. the plants would be built. Google said it has agreed to buy a total of 500 megawatts of power from six to seven reactors, which is smaller than the output of today's nuclear reactors. \"We feel like nuclear can play an important role in helping to meet our demand ... cleanly in a way that's more around the clock,\" Michael Terrell, senior director for energy and climate at Google, told reporters on a call. Technology firms have signed several recent agreements with nuclear power companies this year as artificial intelligence boosts power demand for the first time in decades.","cleaned_content":"alphabets google said on monday it signed the worlds first corporate agreement to buy power from multiple small modular reactors to meet electricity demand for artificial intelligence the technology companys agreement with kairos power aims to bring kairos first small modular reactor online by \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e followed by additional deployments through \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e the companies did not reveal financial details of the agreement or where in the u s the plants would be built google said it has agreed to buy a total of \u003cFIVE_HUNDRED\u003e megawatts of power from six to seven reactors which is smaller than the output of todays nuclear reactors we feel like nuclear can play an important role in helping to meet our demand cleanly in a way thats more around the clock michael terrell senior director for energy and climate at google told reporters on a call technology firms have signed several recent agreements with nuclear power companies this year as artificial intelligence boosts power demand for the first time in decades","timestamp":"2024-10-15T08:54:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-15T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
