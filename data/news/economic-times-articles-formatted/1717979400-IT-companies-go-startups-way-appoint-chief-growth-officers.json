Mid tier and smaller companies like Persistent Systems, Xoriant, Innover among others have also made such an addition recently.The “fancy” designation entails a role that is a mix of sales, marketing and operations. With growth sustainability being a key parameter of the CEOs office, CGOs directly report to CEOs of their companies.When Wipro appointed Stephanie Trautman as its chief growth officer in 2021, the company in a mail to employees said that the “chief growth officer is a new function that will enable the company to achieve its accelerated growth ambitions.”Nachiket Deshpande, COO, LTIMindtree, told ET recently, “Across industry, we are increasingly seeing that successful transformation opportunities require collaboration with ecosystem players on multiple capabilities. Mandate for chief growth officer is to bring these multiple capabilities together along with the partnership ecosystem. Cloud and AI are only enhancing this need and hence, this role has become pivotal for success going forward.”","cleaned_content":"it companies are emulating startups and web commerce firms to create a relatively new c suite executive category chief growth officer cgo to boost growth visibility in a tough global macroeconomy where clients are becoming increasingly cagey on spending money on projects that dont yield immediate returns top tier companies including hcltech tech mahindra ltimindtree and wipro have appointed such officers recently mid tier and smaller companies like persistent systems xoriant innover among others have also made such an addition recently the fancy designation entails a role that is a mix of sales marketing and operations with growth sustainability being a key parameter of the ceos office cgos directly report to ceos of their companies when wipro appointed stephanie trautman as its chief growth officer in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e the company in a mail to employees said that the chief growth officer is a new function that will enable the company to achieve its accelerated growth ambitions nachiket deshpande coo ltimindtree told et recently across industry we are increasingly seeing that successful transformation opportunities require collaboration with ecosystem players on multiple capabilities mandate for chief growth officer is to bring these multiple capabilities together along with the partnership ecosystem cloud and ai are only enhancing this need and hence this role has become pivotal for success going forward","timestamp":"2024-06-10T06:00:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-06-10T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
