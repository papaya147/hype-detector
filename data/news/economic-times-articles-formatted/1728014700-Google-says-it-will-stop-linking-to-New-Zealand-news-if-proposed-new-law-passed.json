The New Zealand government in July confirmed it would progress legislation started by the previous Labour Party-led government that ensures fair revenue sharing between operators of digital platforms and news media entities. The proposed legislation is still in review and is likely to see changes including some to bring it more in line with Australian legislation. Caroline Rainsford, Google New Zealand Country Director said in a blog post that if the bill as it currently stands becomes law, Google would be forced to make significant changes to its products and investments. \"We'd be forced to stop linking to news content on Google Search, Google News or Discover surfaces in New Zealand and discontinue our current commercial agreements and ecosystem support with New Zealand news publishers,\" Rainsford said.  Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc , is concerned that bill is contrary to the idea of the internet being open, that it will be harmful to small publishers and that the uncapped financial exposure provides business uncertainty.","cleaned_content":"google said on friday it will stop linking to new zealand news articles and ditch the agreements it has with local news organisations if the countrys government goes ahead with a law to force tech giants to pay a fair price for content that appears on their feeds the new zealand government in july confirmed it would progress legislation started by the previous labour party led government that ensures fair revenue sharing between operators of digital platforms and news media entities the proposed legislation is still in review and is likely to see changes including some to bring it more in line with australian legislation caroline rainsford google new zealand country director said in a blog post that if the bill as it currently stands becomes law google would be forced to make significant changes to its products and investments wed be forced to stop linking to news content on google search google news or discover surfaces in new zealand and discontinue our current commercial agreements and ecosystem support with new zealand news publishers rainsford said google which is owned by alphabet inc is concerned that bill is contrary to the idea of the internet being open that it will be harmful to small publishers and that the uncapped financial exposure provides business uncertainty","timestamp":"2024-10-04T09:35:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-04T09:35:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
