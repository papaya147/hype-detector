Rising inventory and a lack of attractive new models are contributing to this downturn. The sector is projected to dispatch around 350,000-355,000 units, down from 359,000 in August 2023.

A recovery is expected in October with the festive season.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-08-27T23:57:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-08-28T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
