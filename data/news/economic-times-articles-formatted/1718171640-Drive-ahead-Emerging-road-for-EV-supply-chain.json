With the increasing share of EVs on the roads, there is a need to strengthen the EV supply chain. Automakers are now considering whether to build critical components in-house or rely on suppliers. The growth of the EV industry in India is projected to reach $40 billion by 2030, making the build versus buy decision crucial. As EVs become more intelligent, software companies are playing a key role in providing innovative solutions.

India's IT industry can contribute to the development of software solutions for EVs, including infotainment and vehicle security.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-06-12T11:24:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-06-12T11:24:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
