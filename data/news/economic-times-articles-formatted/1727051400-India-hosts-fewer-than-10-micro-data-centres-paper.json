The pilot will likely be powering a hackathon at a university for undergraduate students via OCC.OCC is an open interface for providers and customers of computing infrastructure, and a network of interoperable micro data centres in the country. According to this model, India needs 10,000 micro data centres to build its compute power.MDCs represent the future of accessible, scalable, and cost-effective AI infrastructure in India, people+ai said in the paper.","cleaned_content":"india hosts fewer than \u003cONE_TEN\u003e micro data centres mdcs which are small facilities designed to handle critical cpu and gpu workloads that require lesser space and needs lower investments a paper published by nandan nilekani backed people ai has found the organisation s brainchild the open cloud compute occ project advocates a distributed network of micro data centres the occ network unveiled by nilekani in may hopes to onboard at least three compute providers for a pilot by october et had reported on august \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e the pilot will likely be powering a hackathon at a university for undergraduate students via occ occ is an open interface for providers and customers of computing infrastructure and a network of interoperable micro data centres in the country according to this model india needs \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e micro data centres to build its compute power mdcs represent the future of accessible scalable and cost effective ai infrastructure in india people ai said in the paper","timestamp":"2024-09-23T06:00:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-23T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
