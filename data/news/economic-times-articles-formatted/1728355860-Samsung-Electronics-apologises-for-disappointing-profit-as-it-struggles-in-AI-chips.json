The company has apologized for the disappointing performance and has pledged to focus on enhancing its long-term technological competitiveness.","content":"Samsung Electronics warned its third-quarter profit would come in below market expectations and apologised for the disappointing performance with the tech giant lagging its rivals in supplying high-end chips to Nvidia in the booming AI market. Samsung said its AI chip business with an unidentified major customer was hit by a delay, while Chinese chip rivals increased supplies of conventional chips, contributing to the decline in its semiconductor earnings. The comments illustrate the challenges facing the company, which has been the world's biggest memory chipmaker for three decades but is battling growing competition in both conventional and advanced chips. The world's largest memory chip, smartphone and TV maker estimated an operating profit of 9.1 trillion won ($6.78 billion) for the three months ended Sept. 30, versus a 10.3 trillion won LSEG SmartEstimate. That would compare with 2.43 trillion won in the same period a year earlier and 10.44 trillion won in the preceding quarter.","cleaned_content":"samsung electronics warned its third quarter profit would come in below market expectations and apologised for the disappointing performance with the tech giant lagging its rivals in supplying high end chips to nvidia in the booming ai market samsung said its ai chip business with an unidentified major customer was hit by a delay while chinese chip rivals increased supplies of conventional chips contributing to the decline in its semiconductor earnings the comments illustrate the challenges facing the company which has been the worlds biggest memory chipmaker for three decades but is battling growing competition in both conventional and advanced chips the worlds largest memory chip smartphone and tv maker estimated an operating profit of \u003cNINE_\u003e trillion won \u003cSIX_\u003e billion for the three months ended sept \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e versus a \u003cONE_TEN\u003e trillion won lseg smartestimate that would compare with \u003cTWO_\u003e trillion won in the same period a year earlier and \u003cONE_TEN\u003e trillion won in the preceding quarter","timestamp":"2024-10-08T08:21:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-08T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
