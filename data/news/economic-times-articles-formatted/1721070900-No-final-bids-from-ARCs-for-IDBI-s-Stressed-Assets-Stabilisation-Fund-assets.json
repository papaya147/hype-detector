Despite initial interest from 18 asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), no confirmed bids were received in the final round. As a result, the reserve price for the auction has been slashed to ₹642 crore, and a new bidding process has commenced. The portfolio includes 239 cases, with a mix of secured and unsecured debts. SASF, originally set up to acquire distressed assets from IDBI Bank, is now winding down after nearly two decades.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-07-16T00:45:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-07-16T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
