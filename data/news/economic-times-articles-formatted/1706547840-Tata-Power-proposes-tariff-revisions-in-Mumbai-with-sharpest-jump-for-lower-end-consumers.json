The utility plans to raise the rate per unit from Rs 3.74 to Rs 7.37 for consumers using up to 100 units per month, and from Rs 5.89 to Rs 9.31 for those using between 101-300 units. The increase is justified as the earlier tariff structure was stayed and a rationalization is needed to address the subsidy imbalance between high-end and low-end consumers. Stakeholders have 15 days to provide feedback on the proposal.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-01-29T22:34:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-01-30T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
