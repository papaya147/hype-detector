On June 29 this year, Matrix India, an early backer of mobility startups Ola and Ola Electric; business-to-business commerce platform OfBusiness and fintech Razorpay, said it was going independent and rebranding itself to Z47, a move reminiscent of Sequoia US splitting from its India and China units a year ago.Bajaj, who cofounded online marketplace Baazee along with Nexus Venture Partners’ Suvir Sujan and sold it to eBay back in 2004, says the rebranding was a “natural evolution” for the Mumbai-based firm.“We were always set up very decentralised, so it is a natural evolution for multiple reasons. The past Matrix fund names stay the same and we still use the brand name ... We (US and India) never raised funds together ... However, we are in the business of venture investing here in India because of Tim (Barrows) and Paul (Ferri of (Matrix US) … They stuck with us across all the downturns along with our limited partners (LPs),” Bajaj told ET in an interview.Most VC funds in India were established as affiliates of US venture capital firms, in the early 2000s post the dot-com bust. These outfits have undergone significant changes in leadership with several offshoots and splits in partnerships taking place, signalling the shift in the industry.The reset in the past two years has been unprecedented for the global VC sector. US venture capital heavyweights distanced themselves from China amid geopolitical concerns between the two countries, while Indian franchises found themselves bearing the brunt due to their sub-par performance on cash distribution and paper mark-ups that haven’t translated into real returns. The situation was compounded by interest rate hikes that led to an acute funding crunch after 2022.","cleaned_content":"during the first wave of venture capital in india avnish bajaj started the operations of matrix partners india along with rishi navani in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e on june \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e this year matrix india an early backer of mobility startups ola and ola electric business to business commerce platform ofbusiness and fintech razorpay said it was going independent and rebranding itself to z47 a move reminiscent of sequoia us splitting from its india and china units a year ago bajaj who cofounded online marketplace baazee along with nexus venture partners suvir sujan and sold it to ebay back in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e says the rebranding was a natural evolution for the mumbai based firm we were always set up very decentralised so it is a natural evolution for multiple reasons the past matrix fund names stay the same and we still use the brand name we us and india never raised funds together however we are in the business of venture investing here in india because of tim barrows and paul ferri of matrix us they stuck with us across all the downturns along with our limited partners lps bajaj told et in an interview most vc funds in india were established as affiliates of us venture capital firms in the early \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e s post the dot com bust these outfits have undergone significant changes in leadership with several offshoots and splits in partnerships taking place signalling the shift in the industry the reset in the past two years has been unprecedented for the global vc sector us venture capital heavyweights distanced themselves from china amid geopolitical concerns between the two countries while indian franchises found themselves bearing the brunt due to their sub par performance on cash distribution and paper mark ups that haven t translated into real returns the situation was compounded by interest rate hikes that led to an acute funding crunch after \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e","timestamp":"2024-09-09T07:57:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-09T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
