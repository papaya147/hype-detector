The change permits connection to the Indian grid if the plant's capacity is underutilized or if there are delays in payment from Bangladesh. This adjustment, seen as a move to safeguard India's energy security, could also benefit future projects with similar export contracts. The decision follows recent political unrest in Bangladesh that led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-08-13T21:19:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-08-14T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
