Fada president Manish Raj Singhania stated that although the two-wheeler segment has seen growth, it is still 20% below pre-pandemic levels. Singhania believes that reducing the GST rate would not only be a policy adjustment but also a socio-economic catalyst, as this segment constitutes 75% of total auto sales volume.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2023-09-15T10:25:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2023-09-15T10:25:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
