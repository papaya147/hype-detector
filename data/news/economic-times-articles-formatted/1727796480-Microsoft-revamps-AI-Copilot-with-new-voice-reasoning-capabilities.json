Copilot can now suggest products based on user preferences, and it can even reason through complex decisions.","content":"Microsoft has given its consumer Copilot, an artificial intelligence assistant, a more amiable voice in its latest update, with the chatbot also capable of analyzing web pages for interested users as they browse. The U.S. software maker now has \"an entire army\" of creative directors - among them psychologists, novelists and comedians - finessing the tone and style of Copilot to distinguish it, Mustafa Suleyman, chief executive of Microsoft AI, told Reuters in an interview. In one demonstration of the updated Copilot, a consumer asked what housewarming gift to buy at a grocery store for a friend who did not drink wine. After some back-and-forth, Copilot said aloud: \"Italian (olive) oils are the hot stuff right now. Tuscan's my go-to. Super peppery.\" The feature rollout, starting Tuesday, is one of the first that Suleyman has overseen since Microsoft created his division in March to focus on consumer products and technology research. Long identified with business software, Microsoft has had a much harder road in the consumer realm. Its Bing search engine, for instance, is still dwarfed by Google.","cleaned_content":"microsoft has given its consumer copilot an artificial intelligence assistant a more amiable voice in its latest update with the chatbot also capable of analyzing web pages for interested users as they browse the u s software maker now has an entire army of creative directors among them psychologists novelists and comedians finessing the tone and style of copilot to distinguish it mustafa suleyman chief executive of microsoft ai told reuters in an interview in one demonstration of the updated copilot a consumer asked what housewarming gift to buy at a grocery store for a friend who did not drink wine after some back and forth copilot said aloud italian olive oils are the hot stuff right now tuscans my go to super peppery the feature rollout starting tuesday is one of the first that suleyman has overseen since microsoft created his division in march to focus on consumer products and technology research long identified with business software microsoft has had a much harder road in the consumer realm its bing search engine for instance is still dwarfed by google","timestamp":"2024-10-01T20:58:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-03T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
