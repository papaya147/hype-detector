This trend reflects a broader industry response to market dynamics and a push for improved profitability,” she said.In FY24, subcontracting costs hit their lowest levels in years: TCS at 6.20% of its revenue (the lowest since FY16), Infosys at 7.70% (lowest since FY21), Wipro at 11.50% (lowest since FY16), and Tech Mahindra at 12.60% (lowest since FY19), according to company data.","cleaned_content":"india s leading it companies have slashed their subcontracting costs or spending on high cost temporary workforce to multi year lows driven by increased focus on margins cost optimisation and enhancing internal capabilities over the past \u003cONE_TEN\u003e \u003cONE_TEN\u003e months as growth in the \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e billion software services industry slowed players like tata consultancy services tcs infosys hcltech wipro and tech mahindra have been scaling back low margin subcontracting or the practice of employing temporary workers at high costs instead they are focusing on upskilling existing employees improving billable utilisation and leveraging generative ai genai to meet the demands of increasingly complex projects industry analysts said recent analysis shows a strategic shift in managing subcontractor expenses among large it services firms said krishna vij business head it staffing at recruitment firm teamlease digital many companies have reduced these expenses in recent quarters focusing on strengthening in house capabilities and optimising cost efficiency this trend reflects a broader industry response to market dynamics and a push for improved profitability she said in fy24 subcontracting costs hit their lowest levels in years tcs at \u003cSIX_PERCENT\u003e of its revenue the lowest since fy16 infosys at \u003cSEVEN_PERCENT\u003e lowest since fy21 wipro at \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e lowest since fy16 and tech mahindra at \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e lowest since fy19 according to company data","timestamp":"2024-09-04T06:00:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-04T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
