Since taking office in July, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has been reviewing the costs of AI. It has already scrapped a planned 1.3 billion pounds' ($1.72 billion) worth of investment in related technologies - drawn up by the previous Conservative government - including an 800 million pound investment promised to develop a supercomputer at the University of Edinburgh. While 1.3 billion pounds is a relatively small sum in the wider AI landscape, Starmer's government faced backlash from industry leaders who said it signals that Britain is becoming less interested in supporting innovation. By comparison France, which is building a reputation as a European hub for generative AI, recently committed 2.5 billion euros ($2.77 billion) to invest in developing the technology domestically. The British government is also considering scrapping a planned San Francisco office for its AI Safety Institute, according to one source close to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT). The office was originally due to open over the summer, and would have seen staff hired in line with market rates, estimated at upwards of $100,000 each.","cleaned_content":"britains labour government is drawing up a new cost cutting artificial intelligence strategy ahead of a crunch autumn budget prioritising public sector adoption of the technology over direct investment into industry since taking office in july prime minister keir starmers government has been reviewing the costs of ai it has already scrapped a planned \u003cONE_\u003e billion pounds \u003cONE_\u003e billion worth of investment in related technologies drawn up by the previous conservative government including an \u003cEIGHT_HUNDRED\u003e million pound investment promised to develop a supercomputer at the university of edinburgh while \u003cONE_\u003e billion pounds is a relatively small sum in the wider ai landscape starmers government faced backlash from industry leaders who said it signals that britain is becoming less interested in supporting innovation by comparison france which is building a reputation as a european hub for generative ai recently committed \u003cTWO_\u003e billion euros \u003cTWO_\u003e billion to invest in developing the technology domestically the british government is also considering scrapping a planned san francisco office for its ai safety institute according to one source close to the department for science innovation and technology dsit the office was originally due to open over the summer and would have seen staff hired in line with market rates estimated at upwards of \u003cONE_HUNDRED_THOUSAND\u003e each","timestamp":"2024-08-29T18:01:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-08-30T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
