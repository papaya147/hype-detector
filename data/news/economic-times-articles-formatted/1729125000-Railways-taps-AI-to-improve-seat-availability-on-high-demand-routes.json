So, the allocation of seats to those in the waiting list can be accordingly.","content":"The Indian Railways is going big on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to better its systems and processes. After installing AI-enabled cameras for checking linen and food, it has deployed an AI model to help in increasing the occupancy of trains. \"One Al model we used for checking the occupancy of trains had led to over 30% increase in the rate of confirmed tickets,\" railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told ET. He explained that the reservation chart is drawn four hours before a train's departure. After that, the AI model can optimise seats as it is able to tell x number of seats will be vacant after say two stations. So, the allocation of seats to those in the waiting list can be accordingly. \"The AI model is able to study data and predict availability of seats, leading to greater confirmations,\" Vaishnaw said. Traditionally, the Railway Board allocates seats per station to ensure that at least some passengers get accommodated from each stop of a train. Using AI, the railways now identifies stations where demand is higher and rejigs this allocation. \"In our railway kitchens, we have installed Al-based cameras. They are detecting abnormal behaviour and cleanliness. In a pilot project in Pune, 100% verification of washed bed sheets is being done using Al-trained cameras. Earlier, only 2% verification was possible through sample checks. Customer satisfaction has gone up 100% in this area,\" the minister said.","cleaned_content":"the indian railways is going big on the use of artificial intelligence ai to better its systems and processes after installing ai enabled cameras for checking linen and food it has deployed an ai model to help in increasing the occupancy of trains one al model we used for checking the occupancy of trains had led to over \u003cTHREE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e increase in the rate of confirmed tickets railways minister ashwini vaishnaw told et he explained that the reservation chart is drawn four hours before a trains departure after that the ai model can optimise seats as it is able to tell x number of seats will be vacant after say two stations so the allocation of seats to those in the waiting list can be accordingly the ai model is able to study data and predict availability of seats leading to greater confirmations vaishnaw said traditionally the railway board allocates seats per station to ensure that at least some passengers get accommodated from each stop of a train using ai the railways now identifies stations where demand is higher and rejigs this allocation in our railway kitchens we have installed al based cameras they are detecting abnormal behaviour and cleanliness in a pilot project in pune \u003cONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e verification of washed bed sheets is being done using al trained cameras earlier only \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e verification was possible through sample checks customer satisfaction has gone up \u003cONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e in this area the minister said","timestamp":"2024-10-17T06:00:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-17T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
