Since then, it has added at least 6,000 workers, chairman Ajit Isaac told ET.“We are among the largest globally in headcount and perhaps the youngest to achieve this in a span of 17 years,” he said.Quess, founded by Issac in 2007, has Toronto-based Fairfax as the largest shareholder with a stake of 34%.Vasanthi Srinivasan, who teaches HR at IIM Bangalore, said Quess has contributed in three ways. “Firstly, it is moving low-skilled workers into the formal sector on a large scale that guarantees minimum wages and social security,” said Srinivasan. “They are adding jobs amid concerns of jobless growth, and thirdly, most new joinees are first-generation workers from their families.
