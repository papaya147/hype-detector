The spike in oil prices due to geopolitical tensions has dented market sentiments. Moreover, the market regulator's new equity derivative trading rules and foreign fund outflows from Indian equities have been directed as inflows into China after its recent stimulus measures are also among the key triggers of the market crash.D-Street experts said that the above-mentioned factors, accompanied by a rise in safe-haven assets like the US Treasury yields and the US dollar index, have pressured risky assets such as emerging market stocks, including India.Narinder Wadhwa, Managing Director, at SKI Capital Services Ltd: \"In addition to geopolitical tensions, Indian markets are grappling with stretched valuations. After a prolonged bull run, certain sectors appear overvalued, heightening the risk of corrections, especially if global factors worsen or domestic growth slows. This makes the market more susceptible to fluctuations, with high volatility likely becoming the norm soon.\"Also Read: China’s weight in MSCI’s EM index soars to highest level since November amid sharp rally in stocksDr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services: \"FIIs are moving money from expensive India to cheap Hong Kong on the expectation that the monetary and fiscal stimulus being implemented by the Chinese authorities will stimulate the Chinese economy and improve the earnings of Chinese companies.It remains to be seen how these Chinese recovery hopes play out. The market direction in the near term will be influenced by the tug-of-war between FIIs and DIIs. DIIs have deeper pockets than FIIs and are more convinced to buy the India Growth Story.\"Lt. Col.

Rochak Bakshi, Founder and CEO of True North Financial Services: \"If Iran attempts to block the Strait of Hormuz, it could lead to a crude oil price shock, with Brent breaching the $95/barrel mark.

They advise that participants take a measured risk approach, as the ongoing volatility may negatively impact the markets and still provide an opportunity to trade short-term volatility trends.Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities: \"The Nifty witnessed a bear attack for the second consecutive day. Sustained trades below key levels triggered a correction towards 25,000. The sentiment has become extremely weak, with higher levels used as selling zones. On the lower end, the next support is 24,750; on the higher end, resistance is visible at 25,300.\"Also Read: Oil soars 10% in five days, logs biggest weekly gain in one year over Israel-Iran war; Brent sits at $78/bblIn the aftermath of a market correction, mutual fund investors often face a critical decision, such as stopping their SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) or viewing the downturn as a valuable opportunity. Historically, market correction tend to be short-lived, frequently providing a chance to buy mutual fund units at lower prices. In such a case, what should mutual fund investors do? Should they stop SIP or use crash as an opportunity?Analysts say by continuing SIPs during such downturns, investors can take advantage of 'rupee-cost averaging,' accumulating more units when prices are reduced. This approach not only lowers the average cost per unit but also positions the portfolio for greater returns when the market eventually recovers, softening the impact of short-term volatility.Swapnil Aggarwal, Director, VSRK Capital: \"Alongside maintaining regular investments, revisiting asset allocation becomes essential in turbulent times. A well-diversified portfolio that balances equities with safer assets like bonds can withstand market fluctuations more effectively. This may involve shifting some investments into bond funds or other stable instruments, which can provide a cushion against further declines.Also Read: IPO frenzy intensifies in September: 41 cos file papers with SEBI; listing gain soars to 114% with 239 issues YTDWhile the immediate impact of a market correction may lead to declines in the NAV (Net Asset Value) of mutual funds, disciplined investors can view this as a moment to reassess their strategies.

Before considering trading gold, two key factors must be monitored: strong labor data on Friday and a decisive gold close above 2685.49. Only if these conditions are met should we proceed to identify suitable buy areas.Outside of geopolitical concerns, money managers are reducing long positions across Asia to fund investments in China following the announcement of numerous measures by Chinese authorities to stimulate growth. Although this shift is in its early stages, there has not yet been a significant withdrawal of foreign capital from India. However, the current momentum suggests there may be an argument for a potential rotation from India to China.\"Also Read: SEBI new F\u0026O trading norms: Zerodha to review pricing after November 20, says CEO Nithin KamathLt. Col. (Retd.) Rochak Bakshi, Founder and CEO of True North Financial Services: This can be categorized as technical corrections, as the Indian growth story remains intact. Such corrections should be expected, especially when markets are at an all-time high. Historically, these technical corrections have been brought into play, particularly with the high cash levels available to domestic institutional investors.One should use this opportunity to nibble into quality stocks and deploy incremental money into their mutual fund portfolios. Though this correction may feel painful, it will look like an opportunity in hindsight, similar to the correction of election results.
