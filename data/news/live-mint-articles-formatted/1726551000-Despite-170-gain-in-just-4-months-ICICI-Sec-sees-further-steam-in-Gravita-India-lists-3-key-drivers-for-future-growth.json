The stock, which was valued at  ₹977 per share four months ago, has surged by a massive 170 per cent, reaching  ₹2,585. This surge has driven the stock to soar by 1220 per cent over the past three years, establishing it as one of the top wealth creators on Dalal Street.Despite this significant rally, domestic brokerage ICICI Securities sees further upside potential on the stock due to several factors. The brokerage cites regulatory tailwinds boosting scrap availability in the domestic market, planned expansion in Europe, and increased use of recycled materials across various products and regions as key drivers for future growth.It believes that the positive impact of these developments will begin to reflect in the company's earnings in the medium term. As a result, the brokerage has updated its valuation method from P/E to DCF to better capture the company's growth potential.Therefore, the target price was lifted to  ₹3,265 per share, up from its previous target of  ₹1,750, indicating a 28 per cent upside from the last closing price of  ₹2,558 per share.Established in 1992 in Jaipur, Gravita India specialises in lead, aluminium, plastics, and rubber recycling, catering to both domestic and global markets. With a widespread international presence, the company boasts a robust clientele of over 375 customers across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas, spanning 38 countries.Simultaneously, its operations within India serve more than 230 customers across 22 states.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has issued Environmental Compensation (EC) guidelines for lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries under the Battery Waste Management Rules 2022. Recyclers can now trade metal-wise Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) credits to boost collection networks and ease the burden on recyclers.Additionally, the introduction of a reverse charge mechanism (RCM) and 2 per cent TDS on metal scrap will create a level-playing field for organized recyclers like Gravita India, aiding procurement from the domestic market and shifting focus from unorganised to organised sectors, the brokerage underscored.Gravita's subsidiary, Gravita Netherlands BV (GNBV), has signed an MoU to acquire the fixed assets of Access Auto Trading SRL (AAT), a 17ktpa waste tyre recycling plant in Romania, marking the company's first venture in Europe. Gravita will invest  ₹320 million for an 80 per cent economic interest, subject to due diligence. The acquisition is expected to expand Gravita's presence in the recycled rubber market and diversify its operations.According to the brokerage, this move will contribute to Gravita's goal of increasing total recycling capacity to over 700 ktpa by FY28.ICICI Securities highlights that India is becoming a key destination for companies seeking recycled lead, with many manufacturers now required to include recycled lead in their products. Indian players are adding capacities to meet this growing demand, as lead is a homogenous material that can be sourced from various locations.A study on plastic waste reveals that over half of branded pollution can be traced to just 56 companies, with Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé, and Danone responsible for 20 per cent. Coca-Cola has set a goal to make 100 per cent of its packaging recyclable by 2025 and use at least 50 per cent recycled material by 2030, which could positively impact companies like Gravita India, said the brokerage.In India, new Environmental Compensation (EC) guidelines for waste tyre management have been approved by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC). Non-compliant manufacturers will face penalties of up to  ₹8.40/kg. The brokerage believes these steps will benefit Gravita India, thanks to its strong sourcing network and multi-plant locations, which ensure better margins compared to its competitors.","cleaned_content":"shares of gravita india one of indias largest lead producers have delivered remarkable returns to their shareholders in recent period the stock which was valued at \u003cNINE_HUNDRED\u003e per share four months ago has surged by a massive \u003cONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e reaching \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e this surge has driven the stock to soar by \u003cONE_THOUSAND_PERCENT\u003e over the past three years establishing it as one of the top wealth creators on dalal street despite this significant rally domestic brokerage icici securities sees further upside potential on the stock due to several factors the brokerage cites regulatory tailwinds boosting scrap availability in the domestic market planned expansion in europe and increased use of recycled materials across various products and regions as key drivers for future growth it believes that the positive impact of these developments will begin to reflect in the companys earnings in the medium term as a result the brokerage has updated its valuation method from p e to dcf to better capture the companys growth potential therefore the target price was lifted to \u003cTHREE_THOUSAND\u003e per share up from its previous target of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e indicating a \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e upside from the last closing price of \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e per share established in \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e in jaipur gravita india specialises in lead aluminium plastics and rubber recycling catering to both domestic and global markets with a widespread international presence the company boasts a robust clientele of over \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e customers across asia the middle east europe and the americas spanning \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e countries simultaneously its operations within india serve more than \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e customers across \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e states the central pollution control board cpcb has issued environmental compensation ec guidelines for lead acid and lithium ion batteries under the battery waste management rules \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e recyclers can now trade metal wise extended producer responsibility epr credits to boost collection networks and ease the burden on recyclers additionally the introduction of a reverse charge mechanism rcm and \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e tds on metal scrap will create a level playing field for organized recyclers like gravita india aiding procurement from the domestic market and shifting focus from unorganised to organised sectors the brokerage underscored gravitas subsidiary gravita netherlands bv gnbv has signed an mou to acquire the fixed assets of access auto trading srl aat a \u003cONE_TEN\u003e ktpa waste tyre recycling plant in romania marking the companys first venture in europe gravita will invest \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e million for an \u003cEIGHT_TEN_PERCENT\u003e economic interest subject to due diligence the acquisition is expected to expand gravitas presence in the recycled rubber market and diversify its operations according to the brokerage this move will contribute to gravitas goal of increasing total recycling capacity to over \u003cSEVEN_HUNDRED\u003e ktpa by fy28 icici securities highlights that india is becoming a key destination for companies seeking recycled lead with many manufacturers now required to include recycled lead in their products indian players are adding capacities to meet this growing demand as lead is a homogenous material that can be sourced from various locations a study on plastic waste reveals that over half of branded pollution can be traced to just \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e companies with coca cola pepsico nestl and danone responsible for \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e coca cola has set a goal to make \u003cONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e of its packaging recyclable by \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e and use at least \u003cFIVE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e recycled material by \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e which could positively impact companies like gravita india said the brokerage in india new environmental compensation ec guidelines for waste tyre management have been approved by the ministry of environment forest and climate change moefcc non compliant manufacturers will face penalties of up to \u003cEIGHT_\u003e kg the brokerage believes these steps will benefit gravita india thanks to its strong sourcing network and multi plant locations which ensure better margins compared to its competitors","timestamp":"2024-09-17T11:00:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-17T11:00:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
