HCL Tech stock price has gained over 48% in one year.“Its sharp re-rating has been driven by higher growth than peers and rectification of its capital allocation policy—fundamentals that shall sustain in FY25 too. It is currently trading at 26x FY26 PE – on a par with Infosys and TCS – versus historical discount of 15%–20%. We remain positive on HCL Technologies,” Nuvama said.While HCL Technologies reported its Q2 results on October 14, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the largest IT services company in India, announced its earnings on October 10.HCL Tech Q2 results beat Street estimates and raised its revenue guidance for FY25, while on the other hand, TCS Q2 results were muted, with weak operational performance and falling margins.TCS delivered modest, but in-line Q2FY25 results.
