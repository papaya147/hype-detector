On Thursday, Joshi indicated that the government is considering increasing ethanol prices for the 2024-25 season, along with a review of the minimum selling price of sugar and sugar exports for the same period.The minister mentioned that a committee of secretaries is currently discussing a proposal to raise the minimum selling price of sugar.\"We were optimistic about sugar production for the 2024-25 season starting October,\" Joshi told reporters on the sidelines of the India Sugar and Bio-Energy Conference, organised by the Indian Sugar and Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA).Following this development, several sugar stocks experienced significant gains during the session, with Shree Renuka Sugars leading the rally with an 8 per cent increase, followed closely by Balrampur Chini Mills and Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar, both rising 6%. Mawana Sugars saw a 5.6% uptick, while KM Sugar Mills gained 5%.Additionally, other sugar stocks such as Avadh Sugar \u0026 Energy, Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries, Magadh Sugar \u0026 Energy, Rajshree Sugars \u0026 Chemicals, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, Simbhaoli Sugars, KCP Sugar \u0026 Industries, Dhampur Sugar Mills, Sakthi Sugars, and Ugar Sugar Works all reported gains ranging from 4% to 5%.The sugar industry is pushing for an increase in the minimum selling price (MSP) of sugar, which has remained at  ₹31 per kg since February 2019, along with a rise in ethanol prices. Notably, the government has not updated ethanol prices since the 2022-23 supply year (November-October).At present, ethanol produced from cane juice is priced at  ₹65.61 per litre, while ethanol derived from B-Heavy and C-Heavy molasses is priced at  ₹60.73 and  ₹56.28 per litre, respectively. Reports indicate that the government views the ethanol blending program as crucial for meeting its green energy goals and enhancing the financial health of sugar mills.On September 16, the Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) permitted sugar mills and distilleries to produce Rectified Spirit (RS) and Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA) from sugarcane juice and B-heavy molasses.In late August, the government lifted previous restrictions on the use of sugarcane juice, sugar syrup, and B-molasses for ethanol production in the 2024–25 ethanol supply year (ESY). This decision overturns last year’s ban and is expected to boost ethanol sales by channeling more sugar towards ethanol production, offering relief to sugar companies facing high inventory levels in FY24.","cleaned_content":"sugar stocks experienced a significant uptick in intraday trading on friday september \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e following remarks by indian food minister pralhad joshi on thursday joshi indicated that the government is considering increasing ethanol prices for the \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e season along with a review of the minimum selling price of sugar and sugar exports for the same period the minister mentioned that a committee of secretaries is currently discussing a proposal to raise the minimum selling price of sugar we were optimistic about sugar production for the \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e season starting october joshi told reporters on the sidelines of the india sugar and bio energy conference organised by the indian sugar and bio energy manufacturers association isma following this development several sugar stocks experienced significant gains during the session with shree renuka sugars leading the rally with an \u003cEIGHT_PERCENT\u003e increase followed closely by balrampur chini mills and bajaj hindusthan sugar both rising \u003cSIX_PERCENT\u003e mawana sugars saw a \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e uptick while km sugar mills gained \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e additionally other sugar stocks such as avadh sugar energy dalmia bharat sugar and industries magadh sugar energy rajshree sugars chemicals dwarikesh sugar industries simbhaoli sugars kcp sugar industries dhampur sugar mills sakthi sugars and ugar sugar works all reported gains ranging from \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e the sugar industry is pushing for an increase in the minimum selling price msp of sugar which has remained at \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e per kg since february \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e along with a rise in ethanol prices notably the government has not updated ethanol prices since the \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e supply year november october at present ethanol produced from cane juice is priced at \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e per litre while ethanol derived from b heavy and c heavy molasses is priced at \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e and \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e per litre respectively reports indicate that the government views the ethanol blending program as crucial for meeting its green energy goals and enhancing the financial health of sugar mills on september \u003cONE_TEN\u003e the department of food and public distribution dfpd permitted sugar mills and distilleries to produce rectified spirit rs and extra neutral alcohol ena from sugarcane juice and b heavy molasses in late august the government lifted previous restrictions on the use of sugarcane juice sugar syrup and b molasses for ethanol production in the \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e ethanol supply year esy this decision overturns last year s ban and is expected to boost ethanol sales by channeling more sugar towards ethanol production offering relief to sugar companies facing high inventory levels in fy24","timestamp":"2024-09-27T12:44:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-27T12:44:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
