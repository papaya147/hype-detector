While various factors drive the recent market correction, there is still some nervousness surrounding upcoming state elections. ”“However, the outcome in Haryana, a focal point for the farmer agitation, is expected to provide the market with some relief and confidence, especially as it looks ahead to the Maharashtra elections. The market has made a temporary bottom around 24,750, and we can expect a move towards 25,500. So traders can play for a pullback rally. However, the trend will reverse only after a decisive move above the 25,500 level,” added Meena.Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, agreed. “After sessions of corrections, India is getting some support at the level of 25,800 for Nifty 50. Contrary to the exit polls, good state election results for the ruling party have brought some optimism in the domestic market.”Also Read: Stock market update: Nifty 50 and Sensex break 6-day losing streak, rise nearly 1% ahead of RBI policy decision“RBI policy outcome, though no cut is expected, a plausible change in stance to neutral is anticipated. And investors are likely to focus on the upcoming Q2 results where earnings will likely improve marginally on a QoQ basis,” added Nair.D-Street experts said Nifty has witnessed a correction of nearly six per cent from its all-time high. However, this can be viewed as a healthy pullback, as the broader market structure remains firm. The market had been in an overbought zone for an extended period, and the decline was necessary to encourage fresh buying interest at lower levels.“Despite the recent correction, Nifty 50 continues to trade above its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which aligns near the 24,400 mark—also coinciding with the 78.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous uptrend,” said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP, Research \u0026 Advisory at Master Capital Services.

The index has moved above a critical moving average on the hourly timeframe.“The RSI has made a bullish crossover in the shorter timeframe, further supporting the positive outlook. In the near term, the index may move towards the 25,350–25,400 range. On the downside, support is placed at 24,850, and a break below this level could lead to weakness,” added De.Ajit Mishra – SVP of Research, Religare Broking Ltd, said, “While the recovery in key heavyweights could drive Nifty further upward, sustaining this momentum may be challenging. Nifty faces an immediate resistance zone around 25,150-25,300, with a significant hurdle still at 25,500.”“Traders should consider using this recovery to lighten positions and remain selective for long trades. We favour IT and pharma stocks for their resilience and recommend careful stock selection in other sectors,” added Mishra.","cleaned_content":"the indian stock market snapped its six day losing streak
