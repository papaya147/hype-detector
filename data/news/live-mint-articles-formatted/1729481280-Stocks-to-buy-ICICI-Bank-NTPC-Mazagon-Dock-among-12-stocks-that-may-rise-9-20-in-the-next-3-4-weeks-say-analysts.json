However, their faith in the prospects of the Indian stock market for the medium to long term remains intact due to the durability of economic growth, the influx of retail investors, and the start of the rate reduction cycle.Vinod Nair, the head of research at Geojit Financial Services, believes that investment strategies favouring China over India might be beneficial in the short term. However, the long-term outlook for the Indian market remains strong, with stable growth and increased capital expenditure.With mixed bias, Nair expects the market to be rangebound in the short term and suggests investors should turn more sector- and stock-specific in such a time.Experts suggest investors must be prudent in stock selection and bet on only quality stocks. They recommend buying these 12 stocks, expecting them to rise 9-20 per cent in the next three to four weeks.
