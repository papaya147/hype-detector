This requires careful planning for those engaging in same-day trades.Stockbrokers in India treat Diwali as the start of their financial new year. Many investors believe that buying stocks during this session brings prosperity for the year ahead. It is also an opportunity for traders to diversify portfolios and open new settlement accounts.While it is a symbolic event, Muhurat Trading often sees active participation, with many experienced investors taking this chance to adjust their holdings. However, due to the short duration, market movements can be volatile.Apart from marking the new year, Muhurat Trading represents optimism and growth in the business season ahead. The session encourages confidence in the stock market and reflects the spirit of prosperity for the coming year.As the clock ticks closer to November 1, both seasoned investors and newcomers eagerly await this festive market event.During this hour, trading takes place across various segments, including equities, commodity derivatives, currency derivatives, equity futures and options, and securities lending and borrowing (SLB).Historically, investors have seen positive returns, with the BSE Sensex closing higher in 13 of the last 17 special sessions. Despite the generally strong performance of equity indices during these sessions, trading volumes have usually been low, and few stocks make significant moves within the brief window.However, in 2008, the Sensex exceeded even the most optimistic expectations, gaining 5.86% during the one-hour session. It closed the day at 9,008, though it remained largely range-bound for the rest of the year due to the global financial crisis.","cleaned_content":"muhurat trading \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e date as india gears up for the festive season the stock markets are preparing for the annual muhurat trading session a unique one hour event held on diwali the stock exchanges have set the muhurat trading timing as \u003cSIX_\u003e \u003cSEVEN_\u003e pm on november \u003cONE_\u003e according to the information available on the bse website participants should be aware that all intraday positions will be automatically squared off \u003cONE_TEN\u003e minutes before the session ends this requires careful planning for those engaging in same day trades stockbrokers in india treat diwali as the start of their financial new year many investors believe that buying stocks during this session brings prosperity for the year ahead it is also an opportunity for traders to diversify portfolios and open new settlement accounts while it is a symbolic event muhurat trading often sees active participation with many experienced investors taking this chance to adjust their holdings however due to the short duration market movements can be volatile apart from marking the new year muhurat trading represents optimism and growth in the business season ahead the session encourages confidence in the stock market and reflects the spirit of prosperity for the coming year as the clock ticks closer to november \u003cONE_\u003e both seasoned investors and newcomers eagerly await this festive market event during this hour trading takes place across various segments including equities commodity derivatives currency derivatives equity futures and options and securities lending and borrowing slb historically investors have seen positive returns with the bse sensex closing higher in \u003cONE_TEN\u003e of the last \u003cONE_TEN\u003e special sessions despite the generally strong performance of equity indices during these sessions trading volumes have usually been low and few stocks make significant moves within the brief window however in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e the sensex exceeded even the most optimistic expectations gaining \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e during the one hour session it closed the day at \u003cNINE_THOUSAND\u003e though it remained largely range bound for the rest of the year due to the global financial crisis","timestamp":"2024-10-20T17:50:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-21T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
