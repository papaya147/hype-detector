Shares of the banking major opened at  ₹1,152.95 against its previous close of  ₹1,152.25 and slipped 1.6 per cent to the level of  ₹1,134. Around 10:25 am, the stock traded 1.5 per cent lower at  ₹1,135.35.Experts expect Axis Bank to report an 8-9 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit for Q2FY25, driven by an increase in net interest income (NII) and reduced slippages.As Mint reported earlier, an average estimate from five brokerages indicates the private sector lender's NII for Q2 may grow by 10 per cent YoY, while slippages are anticipated to increase by 29 per cent YoY but decline by 12 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ).According to brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Axis Bank may report a 13 per cent YoY rise in net profit for Q2, while NII may see an increase of 10.7 per cent YoY. The brokerage firm expects the CD (credit-deposit) ratio to remain elevated and margins may moderate in Q2. Asset quality ratios may be keenly monitored and cost ratios may remain elevated, said the brokerage firm.Nuvama Institutional Equities see a 10 per cent YoY rise in core PAT, while pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) may grow 18 per cent YoY.\"NII is likely to grow 1.8 per cent QoQ and 11.2 per cent YoY. Margin is likely to decline by nearly 3 bps. Growth in NII, non-interest income, and lower provisions would lead to higher PAT. Axis will likely report QoQ loan growth of under 1 per cent,\" said Nuvama.Axis Bank shares gained about 4.5 per cent this year until October 16. The stock has underperformed the benchmark Sensex, which gained about 13 per cent in the same period.On a monthly scale, the stock is down nearly 4 per cent in October. If the stock ends in the red for October, it will have snapped its winning streak of the last four consecutive months.The stock hit its 52-week high of  ₹1,339.55 on July 12 this year and its 52-week low of  ₹951.55 on October 25 last year.Read all market-related news here","cleaned_content":"axis bank share price slipped about \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e in morning trade on thursday october \u003cONE_TEN\u003e ahead of its july september quarter q2 results shares of the banking major opened at \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e against its previous close of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e and slipped \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e to the level of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e around \u003cONE_TEN\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e am the stock traded \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e lower at \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e experts expect axis bank to report an \u003cEIGHT_\u003e \u003cNINE_PERCENT\u003e year on year yoy rise in net profit for q2fy25 driven by an increase in net interest income nii and reduced slippages as mint reported earlier an average estimate from five brokerages indicates the private sector lenders nii for q2 may grow by \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e yoy while slippages are anticipated to increase by \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e yoy but decline by \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e quarter on quarter qoq according to brokerage firm motilal oswal financial services axis bank may report a \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e yoy rise in net profit for q2 while nii may see an increase of \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e yoy the brokerage firm expects the cd credit deposit ratio to remain elevated and margins may moderate in q2 asset quality ratios may be keenly monitored and cost ratios may remain elevated said the brokerage firm nuvama institutional equities see a \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e yoy rise in core pat while pre provision operating profit ppop may grow \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e yoy nii is likely to grow \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e qoq and \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e yoy margin is likely to decline by nearly \u003cTHREE_\u003e bps growth in nii non interest income and lower provisions would lead to higher pat axis will likely report qoq loan growth of under \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e said nuvama axis bank shares gained about \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e this year until october \u003cONE_TEN\u003e the stock has underperformed the benchmark sensex which gained about \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in the same period on a monthly scale the stock is down nearly \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e in october if the stock ends in the red for october it will have snapped its winning streak of the last four consecutive months the stock hit its \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e week high of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e on july \u003cONE_TEN\u003e this year and its \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e week low of \u003cNINE_HUNDRED\u003e on october \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e last year read all market related news here","timestamp":"2024-10-17T10:53:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-17T10:53:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
