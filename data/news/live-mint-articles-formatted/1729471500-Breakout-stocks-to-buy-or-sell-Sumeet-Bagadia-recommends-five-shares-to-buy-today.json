The Nifty 50 index finished 104 points higher at 24,854; the BSE Sensex ended 218 points up at 81,224, whereas the Bank Nifty index gained 805 points and closed at 52,094. Cash market volumes on the NSE rose 4.2% compared to the previous session. The broad market indices underperformed compared to the Nifty 50 index even as the advance-decline ratio fell to 0.90:1.Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, believes that Friday's rally can be a relief until the Nifty 50 index decisively breaches the psychological 25,000 mark. The Choice Broking expert said that the Indian stock market trend is still negative, and it may retest its recent lows. So, a stock-specific approach amid the Q2 results 2024 season is advisable. He suggested looking at stocks that are looking strong on the technical chart.Speaking on the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Sumeet Bagadia said, \"The overall trend on Dalal Street is weak till the Nifty 50 index is trading below the 25,000 mark. The market bias may improve when the 50-stock index closes above the 25,050 mark on a decisive basis. However, the bull trend on Dalal Street can be assumed only after the decisive breach above the 25,300 mark. So, amid Q2 results in 2024 in full swing, I would suggest a stock-specific approach with a special focus on breakout stocks.\"Regarding breakout stocks to buy today, Sumeet Bagadia recommended buying these five shares: Sil Investments, Agro Phos (India), Radhika Jeweltech, Pennar Industries, and Vishnu Prakash R Punglia.1] Sil Investments: Buy at  ₹730, target  ₹785, stop loss  ₹705;2] Agro Phos (India): Buy at  ₹48.61, target  ₹52, stop loss  ₹47;3] Radhika Jeweltech: Buy at  ₹135.75, target  ₹145, stop loss  ₹131;4] Pennar Industries: Buy at  ₹207.73, target  ₹222, stop loss  ₹199; and5] Vishnu Prakash R Punglia: Buy at  ₹312.90, target  ₹333, stop loss  ₹302.","cleaned_content":"breakout stocks to buy or sell after facing the selling heat for three straight sessions the indian stock market witnessed some buying interest in the friday session the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e index finished \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e points higher at \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e the bse sensex ended \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e points up at \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e whereas the bank nifty index gained \u003cEIGHT_HUNDRED\u003e points and closed at \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e cash market volumes on the nse rose \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e compared to the previous session the broad market indices underperformed compared to the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e index even as the advance decline ratio fell to \u003cZERO_\u003e \u003cONE_\u003e sumeet bagadia executive director at choice broking believes that fridays rally can be a relief until the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e index decisively breaches the psychological \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark the choice broking expert said that the indian stock market trend is still negative and it may retest its recent lows so a stock specific approach amid the q2 results \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e season is advisable he suggested looking at stocks that are looking strong on the technical chart speaking on the outlook for the indian stock market today sumeet bagadia said the overall trend on dalal street is weak till the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e index is trading below the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark the market bias may improve when the \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e stock index closes above the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark on a decisive basis however the bull trend on dalal street can be assumed only after the decisive breach above the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark so amid q2 results in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e in full swing i would suggest a stock specific approach with a special focus on breakout stocks regarding breakout stocks to buy today sumeet bagadia recommended buying these five shares sil investments agro phos india radhika jeweltech pennar industries and vishnu prakash r punglia 1 sil investments buy at \u003cSEVEN_HUNDRED\u003e target \u003cSEVEN_HUNDRED\u003e stop loss \u003cSEVEN_HUNDRED\u003e \u003cTWO_\u003e agro phos india buy at \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e target \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e stop loss \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e \u003cTHREE_\u003e radhika jeweltech buy at \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e target \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e stop loss \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e \u003cFOUR_\u003e pennar industries buy at \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e target \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e stop loss \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e and5 vishnu prakash r punglia buy at \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e target \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e stop loss \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e","timestamp":"2024-10-21T06:15:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-21T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
