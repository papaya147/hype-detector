Therefore, the frontline indices closed higher, breaking a three-day losing streak.The Nifty 50 gained 0.42 per cent, closing in positive territory at 24,854 points, mainly due to a robust recovery in banking and auto stocks. Similarly, the Sensex gained 0.27 per cent, closing at  ₹81,227.On the outlook for market today, Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said, “A sustained selling pressure from FPIs, muted Q2 earnings expectations, and elevated valuations acted as a headwind for the market. Insipid demand and volatility in input prices are the hinderance of a slowdown in earnings during the quarter.”“Geopolitical tensions and uncertainty ahead of the US presidential election paved the way for haven asset gold to climb a new record high. While a caution from an auto major about weak festival demand further added pressure on the indices,” he added.On Bank Nifty, Nair said, “Bank Nifty, on the other hand, recouped the current week losses on account of a positive start to the earnings season with lower-than-expected slippages, supporting large private banks.”“We expect the investment strategies favouring China over India may tactically support for the short term,” the stock market expert said.Meanwhile, on long-term market outlook, he said, “However, the long-term outlook for the domestic market remains robust with a stability in growth and a pickup in capex. We expect the market to be range-bound in the short term with mixed bias, while investors should turn more sector- and stock-specific in such a time. Focus will be on large caps and growth areas like staples, agriculture, FMCG, consumption, power, digital, and infra. Buy-on dips will be the strategy on a short- to medium-term basis.”On the technical outlook for Nifty today, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP, said, “The Nifty has moved up sharply after forming a panic bottom around 24,570, failing to sustain below 24,700. On the hourly chart, a positive divergence is visible on the RSI (14), indicating a shift toward positive price momentum. Immediate resistance is seen at 24,900, which previously acted as support. A decisive move above 24,900 could induce a short-term rally. The trend is likely to remain strong as long as the Nifty stays above 24,750.”Around 45 companies will declare their Q2 results 2024 on Monday.
