The Gift Nifty was trading around 25,925 level, a discount of nearly 20 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close.On Tuesday, the domestic equity market indices ended flat after hitting record highs during the session.The Sensex eased 14.57 points to close at 84,914.04, while the Nifty 50 settled 1.35 points, or 0.01%, higher at 25,940.40.Nifty 50 formed a small positive candle on the daily chart with minor upper shadow.“Typically, this pattern is indicating a breather action for the Nifty 50 after a sharp surge. Having resisted around the 26,000 mark, Nifty could consolidate further in the short term. The near-term uptrend status of Nifty remains intact. One may expect further range bound action or minor dip in the next 1-2 sessions,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.Here’s what to expect from Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today:Nifty 50 shifted into a narrow range movement on September 24 and closed flat after achieving a new milestone of 26,000 level.“The short-term sentiment remains positive, with the Nifty 50 index staying above the critical 21-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), supported by a bullish crossover in the daily RSI. However, for the rally to continue, the Nifty 50 must decisively break above the 26,000 level. Until then, we expect range-bound movement, with the index fluctuating between 25,800 and 26,000 over the next few hours to a few days,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities.VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today noted that the Indian markets are currently trading at all-time highs with high valuations. However, some sectors are poised to sustain this upward trend.“I would suggest all investors consider every dip as a buying opportunity. The Nifty index could expect support levels around 25,890 and 25,820 and notice resistance between 26,070 and 26,125 in the next session,” Ambala said.Dr. Praveen Dwarakanath, Vice President of Hedged.in noted that the NIfty 50 did not sustain the all-time high level at the closing on Tuesday.“The Options writer’s data for this week’s expiry shows a strong resistance at 26,000 levels, indicating the index is most likely to close near this level. On the downside, the support continues to be at the 25,500 level in the index, while for intraday 25,850 levels can act as an intermediate support,” Dwarakanath said.Bank Nifty underperformed the Nifty 50 index on Tuesday and closed 137.20 points, or 0.25%, lower at 53,968.60, forming a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe.“Bank Nifty seemed to be weaker than Nifty on Tuesday. At the closing, the daily candle is inching to close below the Bollinger band, indicating a halt in walking on the band. This shows signs of slowness in rally or even a possible reversal from present levels. On the daily chart, momentum indicators are in the overbought zone, which also indicates a possible downside in the index,” said Dr. Praveen Dwarakanath.According to him, a break of 53,700 levels can trigger 53,000 or even 52,200 levels soon. Options writer's data for today’s expiry shows larger call writing indicating a strong resistance at 54,000 levels.“In today’s session, if the short covering of the puts above 54,000 levels occurs, it can trigger a decent fall in the Bank Nifty index,” Dwarakanath added.","cleaned_content":"indian stock market benchmark indices sensex and nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e are likely to see a muted opening on wednesday tracking mixed global market cues the trends on gift nifty also indicate a weak start for the indian benchmark index the gift nifty was trading around \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e level a discount of nearly \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e points from the nifty futures previous close on tuesday the domestic equity market indices ended flat after hitting record highs during the session the sensex eased \u003cONE_TEN\u003e points to close at \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e while the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e settled \u003cONE_\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e higher at \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e formed a small positive candle on the daily chart with minor upper shadow typically this pattern is indicating a breather action for the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e after a sharp surge having resisted around the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark nifty could consolidate further in the short term the near term uptrend status of nifty remains intact one may expect further range bound action or minor dip in the next \u003cONE_\u003e \u003cTWO_\u003e sessions said nagaraj shetti senior technical research analyst at hdfc securities here s what to expect from nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e and bank nifty today nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e shifted into a narrow range movement on september \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e and closed flat after achieving a new milestone of \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e level the short term sentiment remains positive with the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e index staying above the critical \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e day ema exponential moving average supported by a bullish crossover in the daily rsi however for the rally to continue the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e must decisively break above the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e level until then we expect range bound movement with the index fluctuating between \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e and \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e over the next few hours to a few days said rupak de senior technical analyst lkp securities vla ambala co founder of stock market today noted that the indian markets are currently trading at all time highs with high valuations however some sectors are poised to sustain this upward trend i would suggest all investors consider every dip as a buying opportunity the nifty index could expect support levels around \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e and \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e and notice resistance between \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e and \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e in the next session ambala said dr praveen dwarakanath vice president of hedged in noted that the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e did not sustain the all time high level at the closing on tuesday the options writer s data for this week s expiry shows a strong resistance at \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e levels indicating the index is most likely to close near this level on the downside the support continues to be at the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e level in the index while for intraday \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e levels can act as an intermediate support dwarakanath said bank nifty underperformed the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e index on tuesday and closed \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e lower at \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e forming a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe bank nifty seemed to be weaker than nifty on tuesday at the closing the daily candle is inching to close below the bollinger band indicating a halt in walking on the band this shows signs of slowness in rally or even a possible reversal from present levels on the daily chart momentum indicators are in the overbought zone which also indicates a possible downside in the index said dr praveen dwarakanath according to him a break of \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e levels can trigger \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e or even \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e levels soon options writers data for today s expiry shows larger call writing indicating a strong resistance at \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e levels in today s session if the short covering of the puts above \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e levels occurs it can trigger a decent fall in the bank nifty index dwarakanath added","timestamp":"2024-09-25T07:34:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-25T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
