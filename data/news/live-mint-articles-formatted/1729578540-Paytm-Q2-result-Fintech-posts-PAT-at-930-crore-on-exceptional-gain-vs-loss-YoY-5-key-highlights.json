Financial Services revenue was  ₹376 crore, up 34 per cent QoQ, on account of increase in collection bonus in merchant loans due to better asset quality trends, and higher share of merchant loans,\" Paytm said in an exchange filing.\"With even greater confidence in our merchant loan distribution business, where we help in distribution and collection, we have started working with select lenders by giving the Default Loss Guarantee (DLG) for select portfolios. In the long-term, this will allow us to serve a wider merchant base and increase our financial services distribution revenue,\" said Paytm.In a post-earnings call with analysts, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma said the company was becoming more disciplined in terms of costs.\"UPI incentives have helped on costs front. As other factors like AI advances, we will become more cost efficient. The models and costs deployed will become phenomenally low,\" Sharma said during the call. He added that the company had reduced its staff strength by 60% over the previous 10 months.\"We continue to find optimization opportunities on the costs front and we continue to find many areas as possible,\" Madhur Deora, Paytm's chief financial officer, said in the call.\"Implementation of AI across businesses has helped us bring down employee cost by 23% from Q3 FY 2024 while improving efficiencies and making us leaner,\" said Sharma. He added that the company has significantly boosted the productivity of its tech teams by adopting AI.Moving forward, Sharma said that cost discipline will remain a key focus area. However, the company plans to continue investing in sales employees and marketing to drive growth among merchants and consumers.Sharma said the company was focused on reducing capital expenditure by retrieving inactive merchant payment devices, refurbishing them, and redeploying them to new merchants.While this process would temporarily reduce Paytm's merchant count, the company plans to redeploy these devices over the next two to three quarters, which is expects will result in a larger active merchant base and higher revenue.Sharma also highlighted new monetization opportunities emerging from the company's Soundbox devices, with Paytm piloting advertisements that seamlessly integrate branding between companies and consumers. The company has already partnered with brands such as Meesho, Coca-Cola, Mondelez, and Dabur to test this feature.For the second quarter, indirect expenses (excluding ESOP cost) were  ₹1,080 Cr, down 17% QoQ, primarily on reduction of non-sales employee costs, cost efficiencies across businesses and absence of certain one-off expenses.Paytm's share price cracked almost 8 per cent after the company announced its Q2 result. At the end of trading on Tuesday, Paytm's shares were down by about 6% at  ₹684 apiece.Let's take a look at 5 key highlights from Paytm's Q2 scorecard:For Q2FY25, Paytm posted a consolidated profit of  ₹930 crore against a loss of  ₹291.7 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.
