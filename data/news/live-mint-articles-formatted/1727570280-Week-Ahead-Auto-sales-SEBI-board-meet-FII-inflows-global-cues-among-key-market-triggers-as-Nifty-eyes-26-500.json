As the new month begins, investors will closely monitor key market triggers such as domestic and global macroeconomic data, auto sales data, second-quarter corporate updates, market watchdog's board meeting, primary market action, foreign fund inflows, crude oil prices, and global cues.Investors will see intense action in the domestic and corporate sectors in the first week of October. The market's bullish rally was fueled by the supersized 50-basis-point (bps) rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, which showed no significant concerns about the US economy and China's monetary stimulus.Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty 50 achieved fresh record highs for six consecutive sessions and logged a third straight weekly gain. The remarkable performance was primarily fueled by a robust rally in metals and financial stocks, which have seen significant buying interest amid improving global and domestic cues.Also Read: Nifty 50 unbeatable since outsized US Fed rate cut: What should be your trading strategy amid high valuations?After a strong start, the benchmark indices moved within a narrow range during the initial sessions.

China’s economic stimulus announcement has bolstered investor confidence, resulting in notable positive momentum in global markets, particularly within Asian indices.“Softer commodity prices, including oil, are favourable for the domestic economy, and there is an expectation of a recovery in corporate earnings in H2FY25, driven by anticipated increases in government spending,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.\"A visible trend is that this rally was predominantly led by large-cap stocks, which are relatively fairly valued compared to mid- and small-caps, which show signs of exhaustion. A risk to the rally is elevated valuations. Given the stimulus and attractive valuations like China, FIIs are inclined to eastern Asian peers. Looking ahead, investors will be focusing on Q2 earnings, anticipating an improvement in earnings outlook,\" added Nair.Also Read: US Fed delivers supersized 50 bps rate cut: FPI inflows to stronger INR—here’s how the verdict is ‘good’ for IndiaThis week, the primary market will witness tumultuous action and keenly attract investors' attention as several new initial public offerings (IPO) and important listings are slated across the mainboard and small and medium enterprises (SME) segments.
