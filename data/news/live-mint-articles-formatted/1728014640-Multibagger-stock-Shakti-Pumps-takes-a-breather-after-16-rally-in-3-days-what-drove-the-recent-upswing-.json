However, it regained momentum this week, driven by renewed investor enthusiasm.The key trigger for this surge was the company's announcement on September 30 regarding the potential issuance of bonus shares which sparked significant interest among investors. Shakti Pumps' board of directors will meet on Monday, October 7, to consider issuing bonus shares in a 5:1 ratio, meaning five new fully paid-up equity shares for every one existing share, at a face value of  ₹10 each.If approved, this will be the company's first bonus issue.

This demand is fueled by declining groundwater levels and supportive government policies, such as subsidized electricity and exemptions for solar water pumps, which encourage independent irrigation systems.","cleaned_content":"multibagger stock shares of shakti pumps a leading manufacturer of solar pumps and motors in india took a breather on friday \u003cFOUR_\u003e october after rallying \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in the last three trading days to \u003cFOUR_THOUSAND\u003e apiece the stock was locked in the \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e upper circuit for the past three consecutive sessions however today the scrip slid to the days low of \u003cFOUR_THOUSAND\u003e on the nse down nearly \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e from its previous close the stock has been one of the top performers in the indian stock market emerging as a significant wealth creator for investors over the past few years so far in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e alone the stock has surged \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e while in the last one year it is up nearly \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e giving multibagger returns to investors the companys consistent growth trajectory driven by its strong presence in the pump industry space particularly in solar pumps and motors has made it a favourite among market participants after peaking at an all time high of \u003cFIVE_THOUSAND\u003e in early august the stock experienced a period of profit booking followed by sideways movement however it regained momentum this week driven by renewed investor enthusiasm the key trigger for this surge was the companys announcement on september \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e regarding the potential issuance of bonus shares which sparked significant interest among investors shakti pumps board of directors will meet on monday october \u003cSEVEN_\u003e to consider issuing bonus shares in a \u003cFIVE_\u003e \u003cONE_\u003e ratio meaning five new fully paid up equity shares for every one existing share at a face value of \u003cONE_TEN\u003e each if approved this will be the companys first bonus issue a bonus issue is a corporate action where additional shares are offered to existing shareholders at no extra cost typically in proportion to the number of shares they already hold for the june ending quarter the company reported a significant increase in revenue to \u003cFIVE_HUNDRED\u003e crore up from \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e crore in q1 fy24 the ebitda also saw a remarkable rise reaching \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e crore compared with \u003cSEVEN_\u003e crore in the same period last year while the ebitda margin expanded to \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e from \u003cSEVEN_PERCENT\u003e the companys profit after tax pat surged to \u003cNINE_TEN\u003e crore in q1 fy25 a significant jump from \u003cONE_\u003e crore in q1 fy24 with the pat margin expanding from \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e as of june \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e shakti pumps had an order book of \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e crore according to the companys earnings filing recognised as a leading manufacturer in the indian pump industry shakti pumps holds a dominant market position with a \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e share in the domestic solar pump market under the pm kusum scheme an initiative aimed at transforming the indian agriculture sector through the pm kusum scheme led by the government it is estimated that there are over \u003cONE_TEN\u003e lakh solar pumps under component b off grid pumps and \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e lakh solar pumps under component c on grid pumps to be installed india primarily an agrarian economy boasts a flourishing agricultural sector with a consistent demand for pumps this demand is fueled by declining groundwater levels and supportive government policies such as subsidized electricity and exemptions for solar water pumps which encourage independent irrigation systems","timestamp":"2024-10-04T09:34:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-04T09:34:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
