Analysts downgraded the target price on the stock amid concerns over unsecured portfolio stress and declining margins.","content":"Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank, one of India's leading private sector banks, fell 7.2% to  ₹1,735 apiece during intraday trading on Monday, October 21. This decline followed the release of the bank's September quarter numbers (Q2FY25), which missed Street estimates and prompted some brokerage firms to lower their target prices on the stock.Global brokerage firm Phillip Capital downgraded the rating on the stock from 'buy' to ‘neutral’ and reduced its target price from  ₹2,010 to  ₹1,940. It said the bank is experiencing stress in its unsecured portfolio, which it expects to continue for several more quarters.It believes Kotak Mahindra Bank will be most affected by margin declines during the interest rate reversal phase, forecasting muted earnings growth due to pressure on net interest margins (NIM) and elevated credit costs.Systematix Institutional Equities also revised its target price for the stock, lowering it from  ₹2,090 to  ₹2,010 while maintaining a 'buy' rating. It estimates credit costs in the credit card, microfinance institution (MFI), and other portfolios to be 4%, 5%, and 0.4% for FY26, and 4%, 3%, and 0.4% for FY27, respectively, leading to earnings cut of approximately 5% for FY25-27.It values the standalone bank at 2.3x (down from 2.4x) the September 2026 price-to-adjusted book value (P/ABV), expecting an average return on assets (RoA) and return on equity (RoE) of 2.1% and 13.2%, compared to earlier projections of 2.2% and 13.5%.Investec has maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock but has reduced its target price from  ₹2,300 to  ₹2,185. Meanwhile, Motilal Oswal continues to hold its \"neutral\" rating with a target price of  ₹1,950. It noted that the bank is navigating the limitations imposed by regulators effectively, and the potential lifting of the ban would further enhance its operating performance.Goldman Sachs retains its positive outlook on the stock, maintaining a 'buy' rating for a target price of  ₹2,286 apiece.The bank reported a lower-than-expected 5% increase in profit for the July-September period at  ₹3,344 crore, affected by higher loan provisions and shrinking lending margins. Provisions and contingencies, which are funds allocated for potential bad loans, surged nearly 80% to  ₹660 crore during the quarter.Net Interest Income (NII) met expectations at  ₹7,020 crore, reflecting an 11.5% year-over-year increase. However, the Net Interest Margin (NIM) declined to 4.9%, down 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter, due to a reduced share of higher-yielding unsecured loans, the full-quarter impact of regulatory constraints, and increased slippages.Analysts noted that the RBI's sanctions on credit card issuance and new customer onboarding via digital channels have negatively impacted the growth of high-yielding unsecured assets. They expect the pressure on NIM to continue, driven by moderate growth in the unsecured segment and the effects of deposit re-pricing.On the asset quality front, the Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio increased to 1.49%, up 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter, while the Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA) ratio rose by 8 basis points to 0.43%. Slippages for the quarter came in at  ₹1870 crore, reflecting a ratio of 1.92% compared to 1.44% in Q1. Restructured loans stood at 0.06%, amounting to  ₹240 crore.Meanwhile, the bank entered into an agreement to acquire the personal loan book of Standard Chartered Bank ( ₹4100 crore) to further fortify its position in the retail credit market. The acquisition is likely to be completed in the next three months, subject to regulatory/other approvals.","cleaned_content":"shares of kotak mahindra bank one of indias leading private sector banks fell \u003cSEVEN_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e apiece during intraday trading on monday october \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e this decline followed the release of the banks september quarter numbers q2fy25 which missed street estimates and prompted some brokerage firms to lower their target prices on the stock global brokerage firm phillip capital downgraded the rating on the stock from buy to neutral and reduced its target price from \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e to \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e it said the bank is experiencing stress in its unsecured portfolio which it expects to continue for several more quarters it believes kotak mahindra bank will be most affected by margin declines during the interest rate reversal phase forecasting muted earnings growth due to pressure on net interest margins nim and elevated credit costs systematix institutional equities also revised its target price for the stock lowering it from \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e to \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e while maintaining a buy rating it estimates credit costs in the credit card microfinance institution mfi and other portfolios to be \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e and \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e for fy26 and \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e and \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e for fy27 respectively leading to earnings cut of approximately \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e for fy25 \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e it values the standalone bank at \u003cTWO_\u003e x down from \u003cTWO_\u003e x the september \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e price to adjusted book value p abv expecting an average return on assets roa and return on equity roe of \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e and \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e compared to earlier projections of \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e and \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e investec has maintained its buy rating on the stock but has reduced its target price from \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e to \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e meanwhile motilal oswal continues to hold its neutral rating with a target price of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e it noted that the bank is navigating the limitations imposed by regulators effectively and the potential lifting of the ban would further enhance its operating performance goldman sachs retains its positive outlook on the stock maintaining a buy rating for a target price of \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e apiece the bank reported a lower than expected \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e increase in profit for the july september period at \u003cTHREE_THOUSAND\u003e crore affected by higher loan provisions and shrinking lending margins provisions and contingencies which are funds allocated for potential bad loans surged nearly \u003cEIGHT_TEN_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cSIX_HUNDRED\u003e crore during the quarter net interest income nii met expectations at \u003cSEVEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore reflecting an \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e year over year increase however the net interest margin nim declined to \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e down \u003cONE_TEN\u003e basis points quarter over quarter due to a reduced share of higher yielding unsecured loans the full quarter impact of regulatory constraints and increased slippages analysts noted that the rbis sanctions on credit card issuance and new customer onboarding via digital channels have negatively impacted the growth of high yielding unsecured assets they expect the pressure on nim to continue driven by moderate growth in the unsecured segment and the effects of deposit re pricing on the asset quality front the gross non performing assets gnpa ratio increased to \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e up \u003cONE_TEN\u003e basis points quarter over quarter while the net non performing assets nnpa ratio rose by \u003cEIGHT_\u003e basis points to \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e slippages for the quarter came in at \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e crore reflecting a ratio of \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e compared to \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e in q1 restructured loans stood at \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e amounting to \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e crore meanwhile the bank entered into an agreement to acquire the personal loan book of standard chartered bank \u003cFOUR_THOUSAND\u003e crore to further fortify its position in the retail credit market the acquisition is likely to be completed in the next three months subject to regulatory other approvals","timestamp":"2024-10-21T12:06:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-21T12:06:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
