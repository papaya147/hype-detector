The bullion further declined to  ₹76,091 per 10 grams during the day despite rising tensions in the Middle East.The commodity market remained closed on Wednesday on account of Gandhi Jayanti.Gold prices have seen a favourable trend led by interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. The rising tensions between Iran and Israel in the Middle East are contributing to uncertainty in the region, which is likely to drive gold prices higher.On September 12, the US Fed lowered benchmark rates by 50 basis points to begin its cycle of rate reductions. The central bank is widely expected to lower rates by a further 75–100 basis points this year.Positive catalysts for gold prices thereby currently include geopolitical concerns, economic uncertainty, and rate reductions.“Market participants are closely watching this data-packed week, with the prime focus on Non-Farm Payrolls and Unemployment data scheduled for Friday. The overall trend remains bullish, with support placed at  ₹75,000 and resistance at  ₹76,250- ₹76,400 in MCX.

However, Middle East tensions now have increased economic uncertainties and pushed oil prices higher, which could impact central banks' rate-cutting trajectory.","cleaned_content":"gold price today mcx gold price opened at \u003cSEVEN_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e per \u003cONE_TEN\u003e grams on thursday \u003cTHREE_\u003e october \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e lower than its previous close of \u003cSEVEN_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e on tuesday the bullion further declined to \u003cSEVEN_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e per \u003cONE_TEN\u003e grams during the day despite rising tensions in the middle east the commodity market remained closed on wednesday on account of gandhi jayanti gold prices have seen a favourable trend led by interest rate cuts by the us federal reserve the rising tensions between iran and israel in the middle east are contributing to uncertainty in the region which is likely to drive gold prices higher on september \u003cONE_TEN\u003e the us fed lowered benchmark rates by \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e basis points to begin its cycle of rate reductions the central bank is widely expected to lower rates by a further \u003cSEVEN_TEN\u003e \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e basis points this year positive catalysts for gold prices thereby currently include geopolitical concerns economic uncertainty and rate reductions market participants are closely watching this data packed week with the prime focus on non farm payrolls and unemployment data scheduled for friday the overall trend remains bullish with support placed at \u003cSEVEN_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e and resistance at \u003cSEVEN_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cSEVEN_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e in mcx any significant deviation in the data could impact golds short term movement said jateen trivedi vp research analyst commodity and currency lkp securities on the us rate cut front there has been some recalibration in market expectations regarding upcoming cuts following comments from fed chair jerome powell the fed chief tempered expectations of aggressive interest rate cuts at the \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e th nabe annual meeting that helped push the dollar higher towards the \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e level the cme fedwatch tool as per tuesday data assigned a \u003cSIX_TEN_PERCENT\u003e probability to a \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e basis point rate cut at the november meeting a significant increase from \u003cFOUR_TEN_PERCENT\u003e just a day prior however middle east tensions now have increased economic uncertainties and pushed oil prices higher which could impact central banks rate cutting trajectory","timestamp":"2024-10-03T09:25:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-03T09:25:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
