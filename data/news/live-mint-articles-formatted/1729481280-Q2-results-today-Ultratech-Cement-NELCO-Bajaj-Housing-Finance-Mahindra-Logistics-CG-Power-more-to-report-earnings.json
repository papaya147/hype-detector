Further, several major blue-chip firms and banks are scheduled to declare their Q2 results this week.The second quarter results (Q2FY25) season began this month, and a host of big names are expected to declare their Q2 earnings report during this week and in the upcoming weeks. Overall, the earnings reports will significantly impact the markets, besides offering insights into India's broader economic landscape.Among the companies that will declare their Q2FY25 results today include Ultratech Cement , NELCO, Bajaj Housing Finance, Jana Small Finance Bank, Mahindra Logistics Ltd, Tips Films, Union Bank of India, CG Power and Industrial Solutions, HFCL, 360 One WAM, City Union Bank, Cyient DLM, Gravita India, Indbank Merchant Banking Services, Maharashtra Scooters, PMC Fincorp, Rajratan Global Wire, Route Mobile, Supreme Petrochem, Surana Solar, and Swaraj Engines, among others.The domestic benchmark indices of the Indian stock market, Sensex and the Nifty 50 index, showed a recovery in the second half of the trading session on Friday, October 18, a contrast from the initial weak start. Therefore, the frontline indices closed higher, breaking a three-day losing streak.The Nifty 50 gained 0.42 per cent, closing in positive territory at 24,854 points, mainly due to a robust recovery in banking and auto stocks. Similarly, the Sensex gained 0.27 per cent, closing at  ₹81,227.On the outlook for market today, Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said, “A sustained selling pressure from FPIs, muted Q2 earnings expectations, and elevated valuations acted as a headwind for the market. Insipid demand and volatility in input prices are the hinderance of a slowdown in earnings during the quarter.”“Geopolitical tensions and uncertainty ahead of the US presidential election paved the way for haven asset gold to climb a new record high. While a caution from an auto major about weak festival demand further added pressure on the indices,” he added.","cleaned_content":"q2 results today on october \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e at least \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e companies are set to release their july september quarter financial results today on monday october \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e according to bse data further several major blue chip firms and banks are scheduled to declare their q2 results this week the second quarter results q2fy25 season began this month and a host of big names are expected to declare their q2 earnings report during this week and in the upcoming weeks overall the earnings reports will significantly impact the markets besides offering insights into indias broader economic landscape among the companies that will declare their q2fy25 results today include ultratech cement nelco bajaj housing finance jana small finance bank mahindra logistics ltd tips films union bank of india cg power and industrial solutions hfcl \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e one wam city union bank cyient dlm gravita india indbank merchant banking services maharashtra scooters pmc fincorp rajratan global wire route mobile supreme petrochem surana solar and swaraj engines among others the domestic benchmark indices of the indian stock market sensex and the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e index showed a recovery in the second half of the trading session on friday october \u003cONE_TEN\u003e a contrast from the initial weak start therefore the frontline indices closed higher breaking a three day losing streak the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e gained \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e closing in positive territory at \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e points mainly due to a robust recovery in banking and auto stocks similarly the sensex gained \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e closing at \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e on the outlook for market today vinod nair head of research geojit financial services said a sustained selling pressure from fpis muted q2 earnings expectations and elevated valuations acted as a headwind for the market insipid demand and volatility in input prices are the hinderance of a slowdown in earnings during the quarter geopolitical tensions and uncertainty ahead of the us presidential election paved the way for haven asset gold to climb a new record high while a caution from an auto major about weak festival demand further added pressure on the indices he added","timestamp":"2024-10-21T08:58:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-21T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
