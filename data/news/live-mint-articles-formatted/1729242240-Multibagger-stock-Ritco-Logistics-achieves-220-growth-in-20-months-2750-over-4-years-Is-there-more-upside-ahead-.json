Is there more upside ahead?","description":"Ritco Logistics stock price has skyrocketed, rising 111% in eight months and 220% in 20 months. The company's strategic focus on sectors like steel and tech integration through TrucksUp positions it well for future growth, prompting analysts to set a target price of  ₹760.","content":"Multibagger stock Ritco Logistics, engaged in transportation activities, has witnessed a remarkable surge in its share price over the recent months, consistently breaking record highs and achieving significant milestones. Notably, it has demonstrated a strong ability to recover quickly after any dips, often bouncing back with increased momentum, leading to substantial returns for its shareholders.Over the past eight months, the company's shares have climbed from  ₹189 to the current trading price of  ₹400, representing a gain of 111%. Over the last 20 months, the stock has delivered even more impressive returns, rising from  ₹125 to its current level, marking a gain of 220%. Over a four-year period, the stock has surged by an astonishing 2,750%.The remarkable performance of Ritco Logistics' share price can be attributed to its strategic expansion into various sectors, including automobiles, FMCG, cement, solar, and steel. According to analysts, the company has successfully reduced its reliance on the petrochemical segment, lowering its revenue contribution from 59% in FY21 to 48% in FY24.This shift is largely driven by its focus on the steel sector, which saw a significant increase in revenue contribution from 2% in FY21 to 19% in FY24. Ritco’s notable clients include Tata Steel, Jindal Steel \u0026 Power, ACC, Ambuja Cement, and Dalmia Bharat Limited.The company started as a contract logistics provider, initially catering to a few businesses with a combination of owned and hired vehicles. It is now evolving into an integrated, tech-based supply chain solution provider. It operates through three main business verticals: contract logistics, fleet management, and 3PL logistics, positioning itself to deliver comprehensive logistics solutions.Domestic brokerage firm Monarch Networth Capital, in its latest note, has initiated coverage on Ritco Logistics with a 'buy' rating, setting a target price of  ₹760 per share, implying an upside potential of 90%.The brokerage is optimistic about Ritco’s growth prospects, citing its unique business model, increasing customer additions in its Full Truck Load (FTL) segment, entry into multimodal logistics, and contributions from its tech platform, TrucksUp.TrucksUp, designed to tackle issues such as underutilisation and reverse loads for small fleet owners, offers services like GPS tracking, fuel cards, FASTag integration, and vehicle financing.With 1.7 lakh downloads by August 2024 and projections to reach 8 lakh downloads by FY27, the platform is set to be a major growth driver. Monarch believes that TrucksUp could revolutionise the trucking industry by empowering operators and streamlining processes, making it a potential game-changer for both Ritco and the sector by FY26-27.Ritco's asset-light model, manageable debt/equity ratio (expected at 0.5x by FY27), and strong relationships with marquee clients position it distinctly within a fragmented industry plagued by inefficient fleet management.Monarch expects Ritco’s revenue and earnings to grow at an accelerated pace due to customer acquisitions in FTL, multimodal logistics expansion, and the rising contribution of TrucksUp. It anticipates ROE/ROCE to comfortably reach 20% levels by FY27E with further scope for improvement.Despite expectation of robust financials, industry tailwinds, and operational triggers, Ritco is trading at a 40–50% discount to peers. Monarch expects this gap to narrow as the company delivers on the key points. Further, increased investor confidence in improved profitability, including scale up at TrucksUp, could result in valuation re-rating.It valued Ritco at a 20x FY27 PE ratio (higher than its historical valuations but still at a discount to large peers) to arrive at a target price of  ₹760/share.","cleaned_content":"multibagger stock ritco logistics engaged in transportation activities has witnessed a remarkable surge in its share price over the recent months consistently breaking record highs and achieving significant milestones notably it has demonstrated a strong ability to recover quickly after any dips often bouncing back with increased momentum leading to substantial returns for its shareholders over the past eight months the companys shares have climbed from \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e to the current trading price of \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED\u003e representing a gain of \u003cONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e over the last \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e months the stock has delivered even more impressive returns rising from \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e to its current level marking a gain of \u003cTWO_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e over a four year period the stock has surged by an astonishing \u003cTWO_THOUSAND_PERCENT\u003e the remarkable performance of ritco logistics share price can be attributed to its strategic expansion into various sectors including automobiles fmcg cement solar and steel according to analysts the company has successfully reduced its reliance on the petrochemical segment lowering its revenue contribution from \u003cFIVE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in fy21 to \u003cFOUR_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in fy24 this shift is largely driven by its focus on the steel sector which saw a significant increase in revenue contribution from \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e in fy21 to \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in fy24 ritco s notable clients include tata steel jindal steel power acc ambuja cement and dalmia bharat limited the company started as a contract logistics provider initially catering to a few businesses with a combination of owned and hired vehicles it is now evolving into an integrated tech based supply chain solution provider it operates through three main business verticals contract logistics fleet management and \u003cTHREE_\u003e pl logistics positioning itself to deliver comprehensive logistics solutions domestic brokerage firm monarch networth capital in its latest note has initiated coverage on ritco logistics with a buy rating setting a target price of \u003cSEVEN_HUNDRED\u003e per share implying an upside potential of \u003cNINE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e the brokerage is optimistic about ritco s growth prospects citing its unique business model increasing customer additions in its full truck load ftl segment entry into multimodal logistics and contributions from its tech platform trucksup trucksup designed to tackle issues such as underutilisation and reverse loads for small fleet owners offers services like gps tracking fuel cards fastag integration and vehicle financing with \u003cONE_\u003e lakh downloads by august \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e and projections to reach \u003cEIGHT_\u003e lakh downloads by fy27 the platform is set to be a major growth driver monarch believes that trucksup could revolutionise the trucking industry by empowering operators and streamlining processes making it a potential game changer for both ritco and the sector by fy26 \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e ritcos asset light model manageable debt equity ratio expected at \u003cZERO_\u003e x by fy27 and strong relationships with marquee clients position it distinctly within a fragmented industry plagued by inefficient fleet management monarch expects ritco s revenue and earnings to grow at an accelerated pace due to customer acquisitions in ftl multimodal logistics expansion and the rising contribution of trucksup it anticipates roe roce to comfortably reach \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e levels by fy27e with further scope for improvement despite expectation of robust financials industry tailwinds and operational triggers ritco is trading at a \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e \u003cFIVE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e discount to peers monarch expects this gap to narrow as the company delivers on the key points further increased investor confidence in improved profitability including scale up at trucksup could result in valuation re rating it valued ritco at a \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e x fy27 pe ratio higher than its historical valuations but still at a discount to large peers to arrive at a target price of \u003cSEVEN_HUNDRED\u003e share","timestamp":"2024-10-18T14:34:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-18T14:34:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
