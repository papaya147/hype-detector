The volatility index, INDIA VIX, surge by 6.42%, settling at 13.88, indicating a rise in market volatility.On the outlook for market today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd., said, “On the daily chart, the Nifty formed a bearish candle, which indicates weakness. However, the index managed to hold the neckline support of the head and shoulder pattern and close above the 24,700 level. On the upside, the 21-Days Exponential Moving Average (21-DEMA) around 25,120 will be the major hurdle for the index, followed by 25,240. If index sustains below 24,700, then further weakness could be possible.”On Bank Nifty outlook, Yedve added, \"Bank Nifty began positively, but after an initial shoot up, the index saw a profit booking, closing lower at 51,963. Technically, on a daily scale, the index formed a bearish candle but managed to close just above the 21-Day Exponential Moving Average (21-DEMA) support, which is placed near 51,915. On the downside, the 100-DEMA support is positioned near 51,090, with last week’s low near 51,000. Thus, 51,000-51,100 will offers good support for Bank Nifty in short term. As long as the index holds above 51,000, a \"buy on dips\" strategy is advisable.”On the technical outlook for Nifty today, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities said, “Nifty remained volatile throughout the day as traders were uncertain about the market direction. On the higher end, it found resistance at the 50EMA on the daily timeframe. Additionally, the index failed to move beyond 25000, which led to selling pressure that pushed it down to 24700. If Nifty falls below 24700, the selling pressure may intensify. However, if it holds above 24700, a smart recovery toward 25050 could be expected.”Around 66 companies will be declaring their Q2 results 2024 on Tuesday.
