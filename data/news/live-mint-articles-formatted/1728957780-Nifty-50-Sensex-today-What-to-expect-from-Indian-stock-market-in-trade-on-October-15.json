The Gift Nifty was trading around 25,240 level, a premium of nearly 5 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close.On Monday, the domestic equity benchmark indices ended higher, with the Nifty 50 reclaiming 25,100 level.The Sensex rallied 591.69 points to close at 81,973.05, while the Nifty 50 settled 163.70 points, or 0.66%, higher at 25,127.95.Nifty 50 formed a long bull candle on the daily chart, which is indicating an attempt of upside breakout of smaller range movement.“Having moved within a broader high low range of 25,200 - 24,700 levels in the last 3-4 sessions, Nifty 50 has bounced back and is now placed near the upper range of 25,200 levels. A sustainable move above the upper range of 25,200 levels could be considered as an upside breakout of the key hurdle and that could eventually pull Nifty 50 towards the next resistance of 25,500 - 25,600 levels in the near term,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.Here’s what to expect from Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today:Nifty 50 shifted into a sustainable upside bounce on October 14 and closed the day higher by 163 points.“Nifty moved up after a brief consolidation on the daily chart, suggesting a rise in optimism.
