However, they have gained up to 65% in a year.Analysts remain optimistic about the prospects of these liquor stocks, including Associated Alcohols, Globus Spirits, and Piccadily Agro.Analysts said that after a comparatively weaker first half, the second half of the financial year (H2 FY25) may be stronger, led by the festive season, onset of winters, and marriage season. The ethanol production shifting away from sugarcane to grains and other reforms carried by the government are positive for the sector, as per analysts.Analysts say that Q1 was weaker for liquor stocks impacted by extreme summers (heat wave) and hence Q2 may still be better, though this quarter is historically weaker, due to the impact of monsoon.The alcoholic beverages industry saw a modest start to volume growth in the prestige \u0026 above (P\u0026A) vertical this year, said analysts at Elara Securities. Radico Khaitan continues to do well in the P\u0026A segment, said analysts at Elara. They expect the company's P\u0026A segment to see a healthy 14.5% YoY growth in Q2. The brokerage has a positive rating on Radico Khaitan's stock, which is also their top pick in the sector.United Breweries is set to post 6-7% beer volume growth in Q2 FY25 (5% in Q1FY25) as business revives post general elections restrictions, said Elara Securities.The festival season sales, favourable weather conditions and favourable base of last year are a few factors that will drive earnings growth in the second half of FY25.Ajay Thakur, research analyst at Anand Rathi Research, said that the second half of FY25 will be better than the first half. As per Thakur, sequential improvement will be visible in Q2 over Q1.The reduction in glass prices, barley costs, and other factors are expected to positively impact margins, particularly for United Breweries, according to analysts. Additionally, the impact of backward integration is expected to improve Radico Khaitan's gross margin by 50 basis points sequentially, driven by savings on extra-neutral alcohol (ENA) prices, as noted by Elara.For Radico Khaitan's share price, expansions at Rampur and Sitapur are expected to bring significant benefits, according to Thakur.While Thakur remains positive on Radico Khaitan, he prefers United Breweries within the sector. He cites the new management, strong growth potential, and a focus on premiumisation as key reasons for his positive outlook on United Breweries.","cleaned_content":"stock market today liquor stocks such as united breweries united spirits and radico khaitan have faced high volatility in the last one month however they have gained up to \u003cSIX_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in a year analysts remain optimistic about the prospects of these liquor stocks including associated alcohols globus spirits and piccadily agro analysts said that after a comparatively weaker first half the second half of the financial year h2 fy25 may be stronger led by the festive season onset of winters and marriage season the ethanol production shifting away from sugarcane to grains and other reforms carried by the government are positive for the sector as per analysts analysts say that q1 was weaker for liquor stocks impacted by extreme summers heat wave and hence q2 may still be better though this quarter is historically weaker due to the impact of monsoon the alcoholic beverages industry saw a modest start to volume growth in the prestige above p a vertical this year said analysts at elara securities radico khaitan continues to do well in the p a segment said analysts at elara they expect the companys p a segment to see a healthy \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e yoy growth in q2 the brokerage has a positive rating on radico khaitans stock which is also their top pick in the sector united breweries is set to post \u003cSIX_\u003e \u003cSEVEN_PERCENT\u003e beer volume growth in q2 fy25 \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e in q1fy25 as business revives post general elections restrictions said elara securities the festival season sales favourable weather conditions and favourable base of last year are a few factors that will drive earnings growth in the second half of fy25 ajay thakur research analyst at anand rathi research said that the second half of fy25 will be better than the first half as per thakur sequential improvement will be visible in q2 over q1 the reduction in glass prices barley costs and other factors are expected to positively impact margins particularly for united breweries according to analysts additionally the impact of backward integration is expected to improve radico khaitans gross margin by \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e basis points sequentially driven by savings on extra neutral alcohol ena prices as noted by elara for radico khaitans share price expansions at rampur and sitapur are expected to bring significant benefits according to thakur while thakur remains positive on radico khaitan he prefers united breweries within the sector he cites the new management strong growth potential and a focus on premiumisation as key reasons for his positive outlook on united breweries","timestamp":"2024-10-08T15:32:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-09T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
