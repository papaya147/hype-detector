In the second quarter of September 2024 (Q2FY25), FMCG giant Tata Consumer Products reported a slight 0.9% rise in its consolidated net profit to  ₹367.21 crore, primarily affected by the cost of tea in the Indian market. Tata Consumer Products share price today opened at  ₹1,055 apiece on the BSE, the stock touched an intraday low of  ₹1,058.45 per share, and an intraday high of  ₹987.20 apiece.According to a regulatory filing from the company, a year ago, the company had reported a consolidated net profit of  ₹363.92 crore.During the quarter under review, its revenue from operations increased by 12.87 percent to  ₹4,214.45 crore. In the year-ago period, it stood at  ₹3,733.78 crore.Brokerage firms have given a 'Buy' recommendation for the stock of the FMCG company following its Q2 earnings. They have emphasized that the company will concentrate on enhancing growth and profitability in its primary domestic business segments, namely Tea and Salt.According to the brokerage's report, Tata Consumer recorded a 13% year-over-year increase in Q2FY25 revenue and a 16.6% year-over-year increase in EBITDA, which aligns with their predictions. In India, the food sector saw a 28% year-over-year expansion (9% like-for-like), with a 1% year-over-year increase in volume (like-for-like). Salt experienced a 2% year-over-year growth with steady volumes.However, India's beverage sector was negatively impacted in Q2 by weather and competition from Campa (-4% year-over-year like-for-like), while tea volumes saw a 4% year-over-year decline. The growth business accounted for 29% of India's operations and achieved a 15% year-over-year growth (like-for-like).“Inflationary tea/salt cost stays a worry; hence, we are cutting FY25/26/27E EPS by 4%/1.2%/3%. We are cutting P/E multiple for India business to 60x (from 65x) and rolling forward to Q2FY27E, yielding an SoTP-based target price of  ₹1,350 (from  ₹1,390); retain ‘BUY’,” said Nuvama.In its report, the brokerage mentioned that the performance of 2QFY25 was slightly lower than their estimate, mainly due to the Tea and Salt core businesses. The price adjustments for the salt portfolio were already put into effect in Oct’24. To increase market share, the company has gradually raised prices in the tea portfolio.The impact of further price changes in the tea business on margins is an important factor to monitor, especially considering the actions of competitors. Despite the challenging environment, the company remains focused on implementing its strategic priorities.“We thus remain fundamentally optimistic and upgrade our rating to BUY with a revised target price of  ₹1,325 ( ₹1,280 earlier),” said the brokerage.According to Ameya Ranadive CMT CFTe, Sr Technical Analyst, StoxBox, Tata Consumer Products witnessed a sharp drop of over 9% in intraday trading following the release of its weaker-than-expected Q2 earnings. The company’s total income fell by 2.97% to  ₹4,260.42 crore, raising concerns over its future growth prospects.On the technical front, the stock breached its key support level of  ₹1,040, which had held firm since early 2024. This breakdown was accompanied by a significant rise in trading volumes—six times the daily average—indicating heavy selling pressure.Currently, the stock remains in a no-trade zone, and investors are advised to remain cautious. A strong breakout above  ₹1,045 with sustained momentum could offer a buying opportunity for long-term investors, but until then, the overall outlook remains bearish","cleaned_content":"tata consumer products share price dropped by almost \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e following the q2 results in the second quarter of september \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e q2fy25 fmcg giant tata consumer products reported a slight \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e rise in its consolidated net profit to \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e crore primarily affected by the cost of tea in the indian market tata consumer products share price today opened at \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e apiece on the bse the stock touched an intraday low of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e per share and an intraday high of \u003cNINE_HUNDRED\u003e apiece according to a regulatory filing from the company a year ago the company had reported a consolidated net profit of \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e crore during the quarter under review its revenue from operations increased by \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cFOUR_THOUSAND\u003e crore in the year ago period it stood at \u003cTHREE_THOUSAND\u003e crore brokerage firms have given a buy recommendation for the stock of the fmcg company following its q2 earnings they have emphasized that the company will concentrate on enhancing growth and profitability in its primary domestic business segments namely tea and salt according to the brokerages report tata consumer recorded a \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e year over year increase in q2fy25 revenue and a \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e year over year increase in ebitda which aligns with their predictions in india the food sector saw a \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e year over year expansion \u003cNINE_PERCENT\u003e like for like with a \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e year over year increase in volume like for like salt experienced a \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e year over year growth with steady volumes however indias beverage sector was negatively impacted in q2 by weather and competition from campa \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e year over year like for like while tea volumes saw a \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e year over year decline the growth business accounted for \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of indias operations and achieved a \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e year over year growth like for like inflationary tea salt cost stays a worry hence we are cutting fy25 \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e e eps by \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e we are cutting p e multiple for india business to \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e x from \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e x and rolling forward to q2fy27e yielding an sotp based target price of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e from \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e retain buy said nuvama in its report the brokerage mentioned that the performance of \u003cTWO_\u003e qfy25 was slightly lower than their estimate mainly due to the tea and salt core businesses the price adjustments for the salt portfolio were already put into effect in oct \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e to increase market share the company has gradually raised prices in the tea portfolio the impact of further price changes in the tea business on margins is an important factor to monitor especially considering the actions of competitors despite the challenging environment the company remains focused on implementing its strategic priorities we thus remain fundamentally optimistic and upgrade our rating to buy with a revised target price of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e earlier said the brokerage according to ameya ranadive cmt cfte sr technical analyst stoxbox tata consumer products witnessed a sharp drop of over \u003cNINE_PERCENT\u003e in intraday trading following the release of its weaker than expected q2 earnings the company s total income fell by \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cFOUR_THOUSAND\u003e crore raising concerns over its future growth prospects on the technical front the stock breached its key support level of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e which had held firm since early \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e this breakdown was accompanied by a significant rise in trading volumes six times the daily average indicating heavy selling pressure currently the stock remains in a no trade zone and investors are advised to remain cautious a strong breakout above \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e with sustained momentum could offer a buying opportunity for long term investors but until then the overall outlook remains bearish","timestamp":"2024-10-21T13:48:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-21T13:48:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
