This will be Senco's first stock split since it went public in July 2023.The company stated in an exchange filing that the record date for the aforementioned sub-division/split of equity shares would be determined after receiving shareholder approval and will be announced in due course.Senco Gold share price today opened at  ₹1,432.55 apiece on BSE, the stock touched an intraday high of 1,544 per share, and an intraday low of  ₹1432.20 apiece.Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical and Derivative Analyst at Angel One stated that Senco Gold share price is in an uptrend continuously moving in a higher top and higher bottom; today it witnessed a gap up and is up around 5%.

The immediate support for the stock is placed around  ₹1,250.Based on trendlyne data, Senco Gold share price experienced a 129.9% increase, surpassing its sector's performance by 82.11% over the last year.Brokerage Emkay Global Financial Services has reiterated its BUY rating and set a new target price of  ₹1,600 per share for Sep-25E in its latest report. The main downside is the volatility in gross margin.“In our view, Senco is now comfortably placed to meet or exceed its 18-20% annual growth guidance, despite only 11% growth in Q1. On a trailing basis (FY24 PAT), Senco is trading at a 45-55% discount to Titan/Kalyan and at ~25% discount to P N Gadgil. Given the strong execution in FY24/H1FY25E and relatively longer listing history, we believe the steep discount is unwarranted,” said Emkay Global.","cleaned_content":"senco gold share price soared \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e to touch a \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e week high on mondays session after the companys board announced its decision to split its equity shares on friday the board also approved raising funds of up to \u003cFIVE_HUNDRED\u003e crore through a qualified institutional placement qip or other permissible methods senco intends to split one equity share which is currently valued at \u003cONE_TEN\u003e into two equity shares valued at \u003cFIVE_\u003e each this will be sencos first stock split since it went public in july \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e the company stated in an exchange filing that the record date for the aforementioned sub division split of equity shares would be determined after receiving shareholder approval and will be announced in due course senco gold share price today opened at \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e apiece on bse the stock touched an intraday high of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e per share and an intraday low of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e apiece rajesh bhosale equity technical and derivative analyst at angel one stated that senco gold share price is in an uptrend continuously moving in a higher top and higher bottom today it witnessed a gap up and is up around \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e maintain a positive bias with \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e as support and stop loss on the upside \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e is the next resistance however ruchit jain lead research analyst at \u003cFIVE_\u003e paisa believes that the broader trend for the stock is positive but the short term momentum readings have reached the overbought zone and hence there could be some consolidation in the near term the immediate support for the stock is placed around \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e based on trendlyne data senco gold share price experienced a \u003cONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e increase surpassing its sectors performance by \u003cEIGHT_TEN_PERCENT\u003e over the last year brokerage emkay global financial services has reiterated its buy rating and set a new target price of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e per share for sep \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e e in its latest report the main downside is the volatility in gross margin in our view senco is now comfortably placed to meet or exceed its \u003cONE_TEN\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e annual growth guidance despite only \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e growth in q1 on a trailing basis fy24 pat senco is trading at a \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e \u003cFIVE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e discount to titan kalyan and at \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e discount to p n gadgil given the strong execution in fy24 h1fy25e and relatively longer listing history we believe the steep discount is unwarranted said emkay global","timestamp":"2024-10-07T09:53:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-07T09:53:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
