He prefers private banks and IT, despite short-term hurdles while advices Investors to exercise caution with mid and small-cap stocks. Mishra said that decline in crude oil prices, coupled with buying in select heavyweight stocks, is helping to limit the overall damage to the markets so far. Edited ExcerptsQ1: What are the key concerns that are leading to pressure on the markets in past few sessions barring one yesterday?Markets have been under pressure, primarily due to global uncertainties, particularly stemming from the US. Weak US job data has raised concerns about a potential slowdown in the world largest economy, which could affect global growth prospects. Additionally, ongoing debate over the extent of the US Feds rate cut is contributing to market anxiety. On the domestic front, the continued underperformance of the banking sector is also dampening sentiment. However, the sharp decline in crude oil prices, coupled with buying in select heavyweight stocks, is helping to limit the overall damage so far.Q2: What are the possible ways in which markets can react to the outcome of the US FOMC meeting. Will just a 25 bps rate cut by US fed lead to disappointment for the markets?Recent U.S. data has sent mixed signals, and with a 25 bps rate cut already priced in, it’s unlikely to trigger a major market reaction. We believe the Fed’s guidance on inflation, growth, and future rate cuts will be crucial in shaping the broader market outlook, particularly regarding global liquidity and risk appetite. A 50 bps cut, however, could spark a positive response, especially from emerging markets like India. That said, the impact might be short-lived, as such a move could also raise concerns about the underlying strength of the U.S. economy.Q 3: What are the triggers that can lead to upside for the markets?We believe strong earnings growth in key sectors, along with a revival in private capital expenditure—reflecting increased business confidence—could provide the necessary catalysts for a sustained market rally. In addition to steady domestic inflows, continued support from foreign funds will be crucial to maintaining momentum. Furthermore, stability in global markets and positive developments in the U.S. political landscape could offer additional support to market growth.Currently, sectors like defense, railways, and capital goods are still trading at elevated valuations, driven by expectations of strong earnings growth. Investors should remain cautious, as any disappointment in meeting these expectations could negatively impact valuations. On the other hand, sectors such as private banks and IT, despite facing short-term hurdles, are presenting more attractive valuations. In this market environment, investors should adopt a long-term strategy with realistic return expectations.Q5: How should investors approach mid and small caps? How are they being valued now compared to large cap and Nifty valuations?Investors should exercise caution with mid and small-cap stocks in the Indian market, as their valuations are higher than historical averages. While the Nifty- 50 index is trading at a Price to earnings ratio of 23 times, the Nifty Midcap 100 index is significantly higher at 43x, reflecting its strong performance over the last five quarters. Given these stretched valuations, large-cap stocks offer a more favorable risk-reward balance, especially in sectors such as consumption, infrastructure, and banking. Investors are advised to prioritize large caps with reasonable valuations and growth potential, while being selective in their approach.","cleaned_content":"expert views sectors as defence railways capital goods are still trading at elevated valuations said ajit mishra svp research religare broking ltd talking to mint he prefers private banks and it despite short term hurdles while advices investors to exercise caution with mid and small cap stocks mishra said that decline in crude oil prices coupled with buying in select heavyweight stocks is helping to limit the overall damage to the markets so far edited excerptsq1 what are the key concerns that are leading to pressure on the markets in past few sessions barring one yesterday markets have been under pressure primarily due to global uncertainties particularly stemming from the us weak us job data has raised concerns about a potential slowdown in the world largest economy which could affect global growth prospects additionally ongoing debate over the extent of the us feds rate cut is contributing to market anxiety on the domestic front the continued underperformance of the banking sector is also dampening sentiment however the sharp decline in crude oil prices coupled with buying in select heavyweight stocks is helping to limit the overall damage so far q2 what are the possible ways in which markets can react to the outcome of the us fomc meeting will just a \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e bps rate cut by us fed lead to disappointment for the markets recent u s data has sent mixed signals and with a \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e bps rate cut already priced in it s unlikely to trigger a major market reaction we believe the fed s guidance on inflation growth and future rate cuts will be crucial in shaping the broader market outlook particularly regarding global liquidity and risk appetite a \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e bps cut however could spark a positive response especially from emerging markets like india that said the impact might be short lived as such a move could also raise concerns about the underlying strength of the u s economy q \u003cTHREE_\u003e what are the triggers that can lead to upside for the markets we believe strong earnings growth in key sectors along with a revival in private capital expenditure reflecting increased business confidence could provide the necessary catalysts for a sustained market rally in addition to steady domestic inflows continued support from foreign funds will be crucial to maintaining momentum furthermore stability in global markets and positive developments in the u s political landscape could offer additional support to market growth currently sectors like defense railways and capital goods are still trading at elevated valuations driven by expectations of strong earnings growth investors should remain cautious as any disappointment in meeting these expectations could negatively impact valuations on the other hand sectors such as private banks and it despite facing short term hurdles are presenting more attractive valuations in this market environment investors should adopt a long term strategy with realistic return expectations q5 how should investors approach mid and small caps how are they being valued now compared to large cap and nifty valuations investors should exercise caution with mid and small cap stocks in the indian market as their valuations are higher than historical averages while the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e index is trading at a price to earnings ratio of \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e times the nifty midcap \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e index is significantly higher at \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e x reflecting its strong performance over the last five quarters given these stretched valuations large cap stocks offer a more favorable risk reward balance especially in sectors such as consumption infrastructure and banking investors are advised to prioritize large caps with reasonable valuations and growth potential while being selective in their approach","timestamp":"2024-09-13T15:10:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-13T15:10:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
