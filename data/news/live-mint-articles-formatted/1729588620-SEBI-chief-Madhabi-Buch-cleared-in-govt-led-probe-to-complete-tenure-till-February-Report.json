The probe found that the dissatisfaction may stem from Buch's sweeping reforms within SEBI, as her efforts to clean up the system were met with resistance. Considering all factors, the government decided that Buch will complete her current tenure, which ends on February 28, 2025.In August, US short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged that the market regulator was unwilling to act on its January 2023 Adani report because Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch had investments in offshore funds with links to the Adani group.The SEBI chief and her husband denied the allegations, terming them ‘baseless’ and an attempted ‘character assassination’. “We suspect SEBI’s unwillingness to take meaningful action against suspect offshore shareholders in the Adani Group may stem from Chairperson Madhabi Buch’s complicity in using the exact same funds used by Vinod Adani, brother of Gautam Adani,” wrote Hindenburg in a blog post.Also Read: Madhabi Buch received rental income from ’Wockhardt’, company under SEBI probe: CongressSubsequently, the Opposition Congress accused SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch of “outright corruption,\" claiming that she received rental income from an entity affiliated with Wockhdart Ltd., which the market watchdog investigated for various cases, including insider trading.Congress' media and publicity department head Pawan Khera said that between 2018 and 2024, Buch -- as a whole-time member and later chairperson of capital market regulator SEBI-- had been receiving rental income amounting to  ₹2.16 crore from \"Carol Info Services Limited\", a company affiliated to Wockhardt Limited.Additionally, In a letter to the finance ministry, SEBI employees complained that \"immense work pressure\" at the market regulator resulted in a \"stressful and toxic work environment.\" According to the letter dated August 6, accessed by some media houses, SEBI officials said, “Shouting, scolding and public humiliation have become a norm in meetings.”SEBI refuted claims of toxic and unprofessional work culture at its offices, citing high employee standards and condemning few ‘external elements’ behind employee protests.
