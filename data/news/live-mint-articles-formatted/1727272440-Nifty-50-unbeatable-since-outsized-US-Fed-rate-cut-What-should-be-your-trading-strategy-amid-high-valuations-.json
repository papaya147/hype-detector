Sustained foreign fund inflow in Indian equities and robust macro indicators contributed equally to the rally.On Wednesday, the Nifty 50 reversed course in the final hour of trade to close 0.25 per cent higher at 26,004.15 points, with nine of the thirteen major sectoral indexes logging gains on the day. The BSE Sensex was up 0.3 per cent, settling at an all-time high of 85,169.87. Both the benchmark indexes had dropped as much as 0.2 per cent earlier in the session.

The spotlight has shifted to US Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments on rate cuts and US inflation data due later this week.Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd: \"Markets were extremely range-bound for most of the trades, but winding up of short positions ahead of tomorrow's monthly expiry triggered a small rally towards the end, which saw both benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty, closing above their psychological levels of 85,000 and 26,000 respectively.However, broader market weakness due to profit-taking could signal that the current rally may face intermittent hurdles due to global uncertainty and rising Middle East conflict. The short-term technical outlook continues to favour bulls on a backdrop of higher/high-low patterns on all time frames, with Nifty’s immediate goal post now at 26,250 while psychological support is at the 25,750 mark.Also Read: Nifty 50 rises over 19% in 2024, set to surpass full-year 2023 gains amid strong FPI inflowsAjit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd: \"Markets experienced a volatile session but managed to extend their upward trend, with a sharp rally in the last half hour pushing Nifty to close near the day's high at 26,004.15. The tone was subdued most of the day, while sectoral performance was mixed. Profit-taking in midcap and smallcap stocks put pressure on market breadth.We maintain our bullish outlook amid ongoing consolidation and recommend focusing on stock selection aligned with sectoral trends. Besides rate-sensitive sectors, we observe strong momentum in metal and power stocks, while the current correction in IT presents a buying opportunity. Traders should plan their positions accordingly.\"Vaibhav Porwal, co-founder, Dezerv: “The current market levels reflect market fundamentals and liquidity flows. Fundamentally, the markets should deliver 12-15% returns per annum; therefore, we expect 18-24 months for markets to reach these levels. However, a strong buying momentum in the market is fueled by strong liquidity. In such a scenario, markets can overextend. Which means that we may see the 100k number shortly.”Also Read: FPIs turn aggressive buyers on US Fed verdict, pump  ₹33,691 crore in Indian equities; Sept to log highest inflows YTDAccording to traders, investors struggle to find clear directions following a record rally. The US Federal Reserve's decision to cut rates by 50 bps signals a shift in global monetary policy, and its ripple effects are felt across global markets, including India. Analysts said the rally was fueled by optimism about India's economic growth prospects and the easing of monetary policy in the US, which is expected to attract more foreign investment.Sectors benefiting from lowering interest costs might include real estate and infrastructure companies, which are heavily debt-funded. According to market experts, Indian NBFCs have looked outside India to fund their capital at lower interest rates and might benefit from this regime. Other indirect beneficiaries could be discretionary sectors such as automotive and FMCG companies.Also Read: US Fed pivot in focus: Why are gold prices following US Treasury yield? — ExplainedA lower interest rate regime should benefit sectors involving high debt, such as real estate and infrastructure companies.

Such diversification would require minimum efforts to rebalance and provide satisfactory returns over the long term. Indian market valuations are already elevated, suggesting that the potential benefits of a rate cut have been priced in. As a result, expecting substantial returns from investments in rate-sensitive stocks may no longer be a viable strategy,” said Amit Golia.\"India's growth narrative remains robust, as reflected in the markets that command some of the highest valuations globally. Retail investors should focus on selecting promising companies in the right sectors and hold their positions for the long term,\" added Golia of MarketsMojo.According to Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart Ltd, investors should approach this market cautiously, as the high valuations present both opportunities and risks.“While the one lakh mark seems within reach in Diwali 2025, it's important to remember that markets are cyclical. A sustained upward trend often leads to periods of consolidation or even correction. It's crucial to avoid overextending positions and to have a realistic outlook on potential returns,” said Gour.Technical View: Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd:\"The volatility index, INDIA VIX, cooled by 7.37 per cent, settling at 12.41, indicating a decrease in market volatility.
