The Bank Nifty index outperformed and rallied 805.40 points, or 1.57%, to close above the resistance level of 52,000 at 52,094.20 on Friday.Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, observed that the Bank Nifty index reached its support zone of 50,000 to 50,500 last week, following sustained selling pressure after a gap-up opening on Monday.“However, at the end of last week, Bank Nifty recovered back and closed above the resistance zone of 52,000-mark. If Bank Nifty closes daily above 52,000, there is a possibility for upward movement toward the 53,000 - 53,500 resistance zone, which corresponds to the previous weekly high. Key support remains at 50,000, and traders are advised to exercise caution if the index closes below 52,000,” Dongre said.With the 52,000 being a critical level, Ganesh Dongre suggests a Bank Nifty options trading strategy which works if the index stays above 52,000 during the week.Here’s Bank Nifty trading strategy for today from Ganesh Dongre:\u003e Buy 1 lot of the 30th Oct expiry 52800 CE at CMP 286\u003e Sell 1 lots of the 30th Oct expiry 53300 CE at CMP 144The capital required in the trade is  ₹20,000.
