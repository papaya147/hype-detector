The surge indicates robust external economic health, which helps in reducing vulnerabilities to international financial uncertainties.A higher reserve also means that India is in a stronger position to pay for its imports and manage short-term debt obligations. In uncertain global times, such reserves give India a cushion against potential external risks, such as fluctuating oil prices or geopolitical tensions.Moreover, Manba Finance made a strong debut on the stock market, listing at a 25% premium over its issue price of  ₹120 per share.Similarly, KRN Heat Exchanger and Refrigeration enjoyed an exceptional start, listing at a premium of 114% over its issue price of  ₹470. This substantial premium reflects optimism surrounding the company's market position and future prospects.Northern Arc Capital, a financial services company focused on providing debt to under-served sectors, listed at a 15% premium over its issue price of  ₹188. The moderate premium suggests confidence in the company's role in bridging credit gaps in the Indian market, although not as exuberant as the premiums seen with the other two companies.Furthermore, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, ICICI AMC, and Axis AMC have each launched new fund offerings (NFOs) that cater to different segments of the investment market.Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC introduced the ABSL CRISIL IBX AAA NBFC HFC Index Fund.
