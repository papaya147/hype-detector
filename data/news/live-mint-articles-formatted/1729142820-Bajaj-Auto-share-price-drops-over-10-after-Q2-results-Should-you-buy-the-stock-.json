The stock declined as much as 10.88% to  ₹10,352.70 apiece on the BSE.Bajaj Auto reported a standalone net profit of  ₹2,005.04 crore in the second quarter of FY25 (Q2FY25), a rise of 9.2% compared to  ₹1,836.14 crore in the corresponding period last year.The auto major's total revenue from operations in Q2FY25 increased by 22% to  ₹13,127.47 crore from  ₹10,777.27 crore in the year-ago period.EBITDA during the said quarter rose 24.4% year-on-year (YoY) to  ₹2,652.4 crore from  ₹2,122 crore, while EBITDA margin improved by 40 bps on year to 20.2% from 19.8%.According to Chirag Jain, Senior Research Analyst, Emkay Global Financial Services, Bajaj Auto Q2 results were marginally weak on lower Average Selling Price (ASP).“The company’s two-wheeler retail growth has been muted, with market share loss in the fast-growing 125cc category; management expects FY25 industry growth to be closer to 5% than 8% if the ongoing below-par festive performance persists,” Jain said.The brokerage firm downgraded Bajaj Auto to ‘Sell’ from ‘Reduce’, and revised the target price to  ₹9,500 per share, implying a downside of over 18% from Wednesday’s closing price.Emkay Global said it prefers Hero MotoCorp, with its better risk-reward and TVS Motor Company on improved growth prospects in the two-wheeler segment.Foreign brokerage firm Citi has a ‘Sell’ rating on Bajaj Auto and a target price of  ₹7,800 per share, signalling a downside of more than 32%. It believes Bajaj Auto's Q2 results were marginally below estimates due to a slight miss in ASPs and gross margin.Nuvama Institutional Equities said Bajaj Auto’s two-wheeler volume prospects are positive, and reckons 8% CAGR over FY24–27E led by 7% and 10% growth in domestic and export segments.“Bajaj Auto’s presence is improving in the electric/CNG space and the share of these vehicles should rise to 20%-plus in domestic 2Ws in FY27E. We are increasing FY25E–27E EBITDA by up to 3%. We are building in revenue/EBITDA CAGR of 12%/15% over FY24–27E with an average RoE of ~36%,” Nuvama Equities said.It maintained a ‘Buy’ call and raised the Bajaj Auto share price target to  ₹13,200 from  ₹12,000 earlier based on 38x Sep-26E core earnings (35x earlier) plus cash/investments of  ₹814 per share.A healthy outlook and better presence in the electric/CNG space have led to a target P/E upgrade, it said.Bajaj Auto share price has seen a sharp fall recently as the auto stock plunged over 13% in one month. However, Bajaj Auto shares have rallied over 53% year-to-date (YTD) and has given multibagger returns of over 101% in the past one year.“Bajaj Auto stock price has tested its 100 Day Moving Average (DMA) at  ₹10,328 after a sharp fall today. The stock seems to be in a mildly oversold zone and likely to form a base. Traders are advised to add Bajaj Auto shares in small quantities with a stop loss below  ₹10,000 level. Stop levels should be  ₹9,800 - 10,000,” said Milan Vaishnav, founder of ChartWizard FZE and Gemstone Equity Research.At 10:35 am, Bajaj Auto shares were trading 10.77% lower at  ₹10,366.00 apiece on the BSE.","cleaned_content":"bajaj auto share price plunged over \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in early trade on thursday october \u003cONE_TEN\u003e after the company announced its q2 results the stock declined as much as \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e apiece on the bse bajaj auto reported a standalone net profit of \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e crore in the second quarter of fy25 q2fy25 a rise of \u003cNINE_PERCENT\u003e compared to \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e crore in the corresponding period last year the auto majors total revenue from operations in q2fy25 increased by \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore from \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore in the year ago period ebitda during the said quarter rose \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e year on year yoy to \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e crore from \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e crore while ebitda margin improved by \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e bps on year to \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e from \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e according to chirag jain senior research analyst emkay global financial services bajaj auto q2 results were marginally weak on lower average selling price asp the company s two wheeler retail growth has been muted with market share loss in the fast growing \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e cc category management expects fy25 industry growth to be closer to \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e than \u003cEIGHT_PERCENT\u003e if the ongoing below par festive performance persists jain said the brokerage firm downgraded bajaj auto to sell from reduce and revised the target price to \u003cNINE_THOUSAND\u003e per share implying a downside of over \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e from wednesday s closing price emkay global said it prefers hero motocorp with its better risk reward and tvs motor company on improved growth prospects in the two wheeler segment foreign brokerage firm citi has a sell rating on bajaj auto and a target price of \u003cSEVEN_THOUSAND\u003e per share signalling a downside of more than \u003cTHREE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e it believes bajaj autos q2 results were marginally below estimates due to a slight miss in asps and gross margin nuvama institutional equities said bajaj auto s two wheeler volume prospects are positive and reckons \u003cEIGHT_PERCENT\u003e cagr over fy24 \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e e led by \u003cSEVEN_PERCENT\u003e and \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e growth in domestic and export segments bajaj auto s presence is improving in the electric cng space and the share of these vehicles should rise to \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e plus in domestic \u003cTWO_\u003e ws in fy27e we are increasing fy25e \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e e ebitda by up to \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e we are building in revenue ebitda cagr of \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e over fy24 \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e e with an average roe of \u003cTHREE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e nuvama equities said it maintained a buy call and raised the bajaj auto share price target to \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e from \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e earlier based on \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e x sep \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e e core earnings \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e x earlier plus cash investments of \u003cEIGHT_HUNDRED\u003e per share a healthy outlook and better presence in the electric cng space have led to a target p e upgrade it said bajaj auto share price has seen a sharp fall recently as the auto stock plunged over \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in one month however bajaj auto shares have rallied over \u003cFIVE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e year to date ytd and has given multibagger returns of over \u003cONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e in the past one year bajaj auto stock price has tested its \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e day moving average dma at \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e after a sharp fall today the stock seems to be in a mildly oversold zone and likely to form a base traders are advised to add bajaj auto shares in small quantities with a stop loss below \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e level stop levels should be \u003cNINE_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e said milan vaishnav founder of chartwizard fze and gemstone equity research at \u003cONE_TEN\u003e \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e am bajaj auto shares were trading \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e lower at \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e apiece on the bse","timestamp":"2024-10-17T10:57:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-17T10:57:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
