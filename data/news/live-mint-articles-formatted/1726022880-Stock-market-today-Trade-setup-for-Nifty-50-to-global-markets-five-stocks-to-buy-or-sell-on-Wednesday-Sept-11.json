The RSI remained in a bearish crossover on the daily timeframe, indicating continued weakness. Sentiment is expected to stay weak in the near term unless Nifty manages a close above 25100. On the lower side, support is seen at 24900; if breached, the index may decline further towards 24750.”On the outlook for Bank Nifty, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C.

Technically, on the daily scale, the index is still holding above a piercing line candle. If the index manages to sustain above 51,400 levels, a rally towards 51,800-52,000 could be possible in the short term. On the downside, immediate support is placed near the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average(DEMA), which is around 50,950, followed by the low of the piercing line candle, which is around 50,370.”Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts — Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi — recommended buying these five shares: Inox Wind, Laurus Labs, Indraprastha Gas, MTAR Technologies, and JSW Steel.INOXWIND has recently experienced a significant breakthrough above the crucial resistance zone ranging from 222 to 235 on the daily chart.
