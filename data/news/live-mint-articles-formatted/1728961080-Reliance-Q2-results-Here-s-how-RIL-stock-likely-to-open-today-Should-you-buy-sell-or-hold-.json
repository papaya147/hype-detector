Analysis of the price action reveals a fair value area between 2810-2705, serving as a demand zone. The share price is currently below its 200 daily MA( moving average), necessitating the sustained maintenance of the mentioned support zone on a closing basis to mitigate potential losses,” said Kushal Gandhi, Technical Analyst, StoxBox.Gandhi further recommends investors to refrain from buying the stock await confirmation of the price action reclaiming its 200 daily MA.“Despite the current favorable risk-to-reward ratio, caution is advised due to relatively weak relative strength compared to the Nifty50, EPS strength, buyer demand, and less favorable technical indicators. Therefore, it is recommended to refrain from purchasing the stock and await confirmation of the price action reclaiming its 200 daily MA, which now acts as immediate overhead resistance near 2912,” he added.Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate posted a consolidated profit of  ₹16,563 crore, marking a 4.7 per cent decline compared to the same quarter last year. Consolidated revenue from operations remained stable at  ₹2,35,481 crore for the quarter.Reliance reported consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) of  ₹43,934 crore, reflecting a 2 per cent year-on-year increase. The EBITDA margin stood at 17 per cent, slightly down from 17.5 per cent in the previous year.Meanwhile, the company's total debt at the end of the quarter was  ₹3,36,337 crore, up from  ₹2,95,687 crore at the close of Q2FY24.\"Our performance reflects robust growth in digital services and upstream business. This helped partially offset the weak contribution from the O2C (oil-to-chemicals) business, which was impacted by unfavourable global demand-supply dynamics,\" said Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries Limited.On Monday, Reliance Industries shares ended 0.11% higher at  ₹2,745.20 apiece on the BSE.","cleaned_content":"reliance industries share price will be in focus on tuesday after the oil to telecom conglomerate reported its financial results for the second quarter of fy25 reliance industries on monday reported a decline in net profit for the july september quarter primarily driven by weaker performance in its core oil to chemicals segment and its retail business investors will be paying close attention to the heavyweight ril stock on tuesday october \u003cONE_TEN\u003e as the quarterly results are expected to impact the stocks movement the current trading pattern of reliance industries share price indicates a period of consolidation within a \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e range lacking a clear directional bias analysis of the price action reveals a fair value area between \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e serving as a demand zone the share price is currently below its \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e daily ma moving average necessitating the sustained maintenance of the mentioned support zone on a closing basis to mitigate potential losses said kushal gandhi technical analyst stoxbox gandhi further recommends investors to refrain from buying the stock await confirmation of the price action reclaiming its \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e daily ma despite the current favorable risk to reward ratio caution is advised due to relatively weak relative strength compared to the nifty50 eps strength buyer demand and less favorable technical indicators therefore it is recommended to refrain from purchasing the stock and await confirmation of the price action reclaiming its \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e daily ma which now acts as immediate overhead resistance near \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e he added mukesh ambani led conglomerate posted a consolidated profit of \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore marking a \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e decline compared to the same quarter last year consolidated revenue from operations remained stable at \u003cTWO_HUNDRED_THOUSAND\u003e crore for the quarter reliance reported consolidated ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization of \u003cFOUR_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore reflecting a \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e year on year increase the ebitda margin stood at \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e slightly down from \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in the previous year meanwhile the companys total debt at the end of the quarter was \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED_THOUSAND\u003e crore up from \u003cTWO_HUNDRED_THOUSAND\u003e crore at the close of q2fy24 our performance reflects robust growth in digital services and upstream business this helped partially offset the weak contribution from the o2c oil to chemicals business which was impacted by unfavourable global demand supply dynamics said mukesh d ambani chairman and managing director of reliance industries limited on monday reliance industries shares ended \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e higher at \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e apiece on the bse","timestamp":"2024-10-15T08:28:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-15T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
