Jefferies has lowered its target price to  ₹167. Morgan Stanley has also cut its target price to  ₹170.","content":"Manappuram Finance shares plunged 15% during early trading on Friday, October 18 to their 11-month low of  ₹150.73 apiece. This decline followed a downgrade from analysts who revised their target price downwards for the stock in response to recent regulatory restrictions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on its subsidiary, Asirvad Micro Finance.On Thursday, the RBI announced that it has prohibited four non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), including Asirvad Micro Finance, from sanctioning or disbursing loans. This action was taken due to concerns regarding \"usurious\" pricing practices, with these companies reportedly charging significantly higher markups compared to their funding costs.The restrictions affecting Asirvad Micro Finance, along with Arohan Financial Services, DMI Finance, and Navi Finserv, will take effect at the close of business on October 21, as stated in the RBI’s release.The RBI's investigation revealed that the pricing strategies employed by these NBFCs were excessive and failed to comply with established regulations. Additionally, the companies did not adhere to the guidelines regarding the assessment of borrowers' household incomes and their ability to repay microfinance loans.The central bank also highlighted issues such as non-compliance with norms that lead to the continuous renewal of loans and a lack of transparency in disclosing interest rates and associated fees to customers.Despite previous warnings from the RBI over the past few months, these companies continued to engage in such practices, prompting the regulator to emphasise the importance of responsible use of their regulatory freedoms to ensure fair, reasonable, and transparent pricing, particularly for small-value loans.In the recent monetary policy meeting, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das expressed concerns that some Indian NBFCs are aggressively pursuing growth while chasing excessive returns on equity, potentially jeopardising financial stability.Morgan Stanley has downgraded Manappuram Finance to Equal Weight (EW), reducing the target price to  ₹170 as it believes RBI's prohibition on new business activities by Asirvad Micro Finance is expected to materially impact profits in both the short and long term.It has cut consolidated earnings forecasts by 20% for FY25 and 30% for FY26-27. While the standalone valuation remains attractive, it may take some time for investor interest to rebound, it added.Similarly, Jefferies downgraded the stock to 'Hold', lowering its target price to  ₹167. The RBI's ban on loan disbursements from the subsidiary Asirvad, which accounts for 27% of consolidated assets under management (AUM), presents challenges for growth, it said.Jefferies has revised its earnings per share (EPS) estimates downwards by 11-19% for FY25-27. Although shares may come under pressure, with a valuation at 0.9x FY26E book value, the potential downside is expected to be limited, it added.","cleaned_content":"manappuram finance shares plunged \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e during early trading on friday october \u003cONE_TEN\u003e to their \u003cONE_TEN\u003e month low of \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e apiece this decline followed a downgrade from analysts who revised their target price downwards for the stock in response to recent regulatory restrictions imposed by the reserve bank of india rbi on its subsidiary asirvad micro finance on thursday the rbi announced that it has prohibited four non banking financial companies nbfcs including asirvad micro finance from sanctioning or disbursing loans this action was taken due to concerns regarding usurious pricing practices with these companies reportedly charging significantly higher markups compared to their funding costs the restrictions affecting asirvad micro finance along with arohan financial services dmi finance and navi finserv will take effect at the close of business on october \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e as stated in the rbi s release the rbis investigation revealed that the pricing strategies employed by these nbfcs were excessive and failed to comply with established regulations additionally the companies did not adhere to the guidelines regarding the assessment of borrowers household incomes and their ability to repay microfinance loans the central bank also highlighted issues such as non compliance with norms that lead to the continuous renewal of loans and a lack of transparency in disclosing interest rates and associated fees to customers despite previous warnings from the rbi over the past few months these companies continued to engage in such practices prompting the regulator to emphasise the importance of responsible use of their regulatory freedoms to ensure fair reasonable and transparent pricing particularly for small value loans in the recent monetary policy meeting rbi governor shaktikanta das expressed concerns that some indian nbfcs are aggressively pursuing growth while chasing excessive returns on equity potentially jeopardising financial stability morgan stanley has downgraded manappuram finance to equal weight ew reducing the target price to \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e as it believes rbis prohibition on new business activities by asirvad micro finance is expected to materially impact profits in both the short and long term it has cut consolidated earnings forecasts by \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e for fy25 and \u003cTHREE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e for fy26 \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e while the standalone valuation remains attractive it may take some time for investor interest to rebound it added similarly jefferies downgraded the stock to hold lowering its target price to \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e the rbis ban on loan disbursements from the subsidiary asirvad which accounts for \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of consolidated assets under management aum presents challenges for growth it said jefferies has revised its earnings per share eps estimates downwards by \u003cONE_TEN\u003e \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e for fy25 \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e although shares may come under pressure with a valuation at \u003cZERO_\u003e x fy26e book value the potential downside is expected to be limited it added","timestamp":"2024-10-18T10:08:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-18T10:08:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
