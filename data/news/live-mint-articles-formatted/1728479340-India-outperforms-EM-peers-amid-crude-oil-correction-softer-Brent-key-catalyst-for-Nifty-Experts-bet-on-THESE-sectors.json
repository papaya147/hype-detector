This divergence can be attributed to “risk-off” sentiments, led by concerns over global demand and recessionary risks during crude corrections in the past.During periods of a crude price drop, metals tend to struggle, with an average decline of 13.4 per cent. However, once crude prices stabilize, metals emerge as the best-performing sector, delivering a robust 71 per cent return in the 12 months following the stabilization. A rebound leads to this recovery in global demand and commodity prices.Lower crude prices benefit building materials, FMCG, chemicals, and pharma, which benefit from lower input costs, resulting in improved profitability.

A 10 per cent decline in crude prices typically leads to a 57 bps improvement in EBITDA margin.FMCG: Lower crude prices reduce packaging and transportation costs, resulting in an average EBITDA margin of 20 per cent when crude is in the $61-75/bbl range.Pharma: Benefiting from a 50-70 bps improvement in EBITDA margin for every 10 per cent drop in crude prices, Pharma's average EBITDA margin remains
