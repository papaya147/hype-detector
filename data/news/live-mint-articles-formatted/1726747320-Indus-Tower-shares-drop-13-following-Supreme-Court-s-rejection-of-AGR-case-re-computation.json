With added interest, this amount has risen to  ₹70,320 crore by the end of FY24.Earlier this month, global brokerage firm Goldman Sachs downgraded Indus Towers from a 'Neutral' rating to 'Sell,' lowering the target price to  ₹220. The firm also set a target price of just  ₹2.5 for Vi, indicating a potential downside of up to 83%.Commenting on Indus Towers, the global brokerage firm noted a disconnect between the company’s fundamentals and its current valuations. It believes the recent re-rating of Indus is overdone, with limited clarity on the company’s medium- to long-term growth prospects.The firm also mentioned that it would adopt a more positive outlook on Indus Towers if Vodafone Idea successfully strengthens its balance sheet.IIFL Securities suggests that Vodafone Idea's cash flow challenges are likely to intensify without court intervention. The rejection of the curative petition, however, offers a modestly positive outlook for Bharti Airtel, particularly regarding potential market share growth.Over the past year, Indus Towers' shares have risen by 108 per cent, with a nearly 90 per cent increase year-to-date.On August 28, 2024, the board of Indus Towers approved a buyback of 5.67 crore shares, which will raise Bharti Airtel's stake in the company to over 50 percent, effectively making Indus Towers a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel.","cleaned_content":"shares of indus towers dropped by \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e on thursday hitting a low of \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e on the bse following the supreme courts ruling in the adjusted gross revenue agr case which denied telecom companies request for a re computation the supreme court upheld its previous decision on the agr issue insisting that telecom companies pay the full amount of the agr dues last year airtel and vi had appealed to the supreme court to reconsider an earlier ruling which had rejected their claims of arithmetical errors in the department of telecommunications dot calculation of agr dues seeking a hearing in open court for their curative petitions in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e the supreme court upheld the department of telecoms agr demand against vi imposing a financial burden of \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore with added interest this amount has risen to \u003cSEVEN_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore by the end of fy24 earlier this month global brokerage firm goldman sachs downgraded indus towers from a neutral rating to sell lowering the target price to \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e the firm also set a target price of just \u003cTWO_\u003e for vi indicating a potential downside of up to \u003cEIGHT_TEN_PERCENT\u003e commenting on indus towers the global brokerage firm noted a disconnect between the company s fundamentals and its current valuations it believes the recent re rating of indus is overdone with limited clarity on the company s medium to long term growth prospects the firm also mentioned that it would adopt a more positive outlook on indus towers if vodafone idea successfully strengthens its balance sheet iifl securities suggests that vodafone ideas cash flow challenges are likely to intensify without court intervention the rejection of the curative petition however offers a modestly positive outlook for bharti airtel particularly regarding potential market share growth over the past year indus towers shares have risen by \u003cONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e with a nearly \u003cNINE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e increase year to date on august \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e the board of indus towers approved a buyback of \u003cFIVE_\u003e crore shares which will raise bharti airtels stake in the company to over \u003cFIVE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e effectively making indus towers a subsidiary of bharti airtel","timestamp":"2024-09-19T17:32:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-20T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
