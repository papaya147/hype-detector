Paytm shares have jumped more than 61% in three months, while its year-to-date (YTD) returns stand at just over 4%.","content":"Paytm share price jumped over 3% on Tuesday after the company received ratings upgrade from a domestic brokerage firm. Paytm shares gained as much as 3.30% to  ₹673.05 apiece on the BSE.Emkay Global Financial Services upgraded its rating on One 97 Communications, the parent company of fintech giant Paytm, to ‘Add’ from ‘Reduce’, while raising its DCF-based target price by 100% to  ₹750 per share from  ₹375 earlier. Paytm share price target implies an upside of over 15% from Monday’s closing price.The brokerage firm cited easing regulatory pressures and effective cost optimization strategies of the company for its positive outlook.“Easing regulatory stance shall pave the way for approvals from the NPCI and RBI to onboard new users / online merchants which should drive the business turnaround. This, coupled with its cost optimization measures, should put Paytm on the early path to profitability,” said Anand Dama, Senior Research Analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services.Emkay Global emphasizes Paytm’s strong position in the market, having retained its merchant franchise at approximately 41 million. Additionally, it said Paytm has successfully transitioned its user base to new partner banks, noting that the company’s merchant lending business is expected to become a key growth driver in the near-to-medium term.Moreover, Paytm’s cost optimization measures have been central to the firm’s strategy. Dama said that Paytm has embarked on a significant cost-cutting initiative through voluntary and involuntary staff attrition, while also limiting marketing spends as the payment business shifts primarily to UPI.Thus, we expect opex (ex-depreciation/ESOP) to fall 15% YoY in FY25E. This, along with improving traction in its broking business and interest income on sale proceeds from the entertainment business, should help it turn Operating EBITDA (ex-ESOP and UPI incentives) positive by 4QFY25E,” Dama said.Better revenue growth from the reinvigorated payment and lending business, continued cost optimization, and reducing ESOP cost should further help it turn PAT positive by FY27E versus FY28E earlier, he added.In Q1FY25, Paytm reported operating revenue of  ₹1,502 crore and a Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of  ₹4.3 lakh crore, marking a 27% year-on-year increase, underscoring the company’s resilience and growth potential in the evolving financial services landscape.Paytm shares are currently trading at a premium (EV/TTM operating revenue: 4x) to profitable global paytech peers like PayPal or Paysafe (2.3x), given India’s growth premium, as well as due to its differentiated loan distribution business; however, it is still at a discount to profitable BNPL players like Affirm (4.9x), the brokerage firm noted.It believes Paytm’s further re-rating will be contingent on faster recouping of lost consumer MTU, strong bounce-back in the lending business as partner/attrition issues ease, and no further regulatory disruption.Paytm share price has recently gained momentum and the stock has risen over 19% in one month. Paytm shares have jumped more than 61% in three months, while its year-to-date (YTD) returns stand at just over 4%.At 11:25 am, Paytm shares were trading 1.50% higher at  ₹661.25 apiece on the BSE.","cleaned_content":"paytm share price jumped over \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e on tuesday after the company received ratings upgrade from a domestic brokerage firm paytm shares gained as much as \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cSIX_HUNDRED\u003e apiece on the bse emkay global financial services upgraded its rating on one \u003cNINE_TEN\u003e communications the parent company of fintech giant paytm to add from reduce while raising its dcf based target price by \u003cONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cSEVEN_HUNDRED\u003e per share from \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e earlier paytm share price target implies an upside of over \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e from monday s closing price the brokerage firm cited easing regulatory pressures and effective cost optimization strategies of the company for its positive outlook easing regulatory stance shall pave the way for approvals from the npci and rbi to onboard new users online merchants which should drive the business turnaround this coupled with its cost optimization measures should put paytm on the early path to profitability said anand dama senior research analyst at emkay global financial services emkay global emphasizes paytm s strong position in the market having retained its merchant franchise at approximately \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e million additionally it said paytm has successfully transitioned its user base to new partner banks noting that the company s merchant lending business is expected to become a key growth driver in the near to medium term moreover paytm s cost optimization measures have been central to the firm s strategy dama said that paytm has embarked on a significant cost cutting initiative through voluntary and involuntary staff attrition while also limiting marketing spends as the payment business shifts primarily to upi thus we expect opex ex depreciation esop to fall \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e yoy in fy25e this along with improving traction in its broking business and interest income on sale proceeds from the entertainment business should help it turn operating ebitda ex esop and upi incentives positive by \u003cFOUR_\u003e qfy25e dama said better revenue growth from the reinvigorated payment and lending business continued cost optimization and reducing esop cost should further help it turn pat positive by fy27e versus fy28e earlier he added in q1fy25 paytm reported operating revenue of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e crore and a gross merchandise value gmv of \u003cFOUR_\u003e lakh crore marking a \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e year on year increase underscoring the company s resilience and growth potential in the evolving financial services landscape paytm shares are currently trading at a premium ev ttm operating revenue \u003cFOUR_\u003e x to profitable global paytech peers like paypal or paysafe \u003cTWO_\u003e x given india s growth premium as well as due to its differentiated loan distribution business however it is still at a discount to profitable bnpl players like affirm \u003cFOUR_\u003e x the brokerage firm noted it believes paytm s further re rating will be contingent on faster recouping of lost consumer mtu strong bounce back in the lending business as partner attrition issues ease and no further regulatory disruption paytm share price has recently gained momentum and the stock has risen over \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in one month paytm shares have jumped more than \u003cSIX_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in three months while its year to date ytd returns stand at just over \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e at \u003cONE_TEN\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e am paytm shares were trading \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e higher at \u003cSIX_HUNDRED\u003e apiece on the bse","timestamp":"2024-09-24T11:26:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-24T11:26:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
