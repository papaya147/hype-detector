The Sensex hit its fresh record high of 84,980.53, while the Nifty 50 made a fresh peak of 25,956 during the session.The Sensex finally closed 384 points, or 0.45 per cent, higher at 84,928.61, while the Nifty 50 ended 148 points, or 0.57 per cent, up at 25,939.05.The mid and smallcap indices on the BSE also saw significant gains, rising by 0.73 per cent each. The across-the-board buying shot up the cumulative market capitalisation of the firms listed on the BSE to  ₹476 lakh crore from nearly  ₹472 lakh crore in the previous session, making investors richer by about  ₹4 lakh crore in a single session.Shares of Mahindra and Mahindra, SBI, Bharti Airtel, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HUL and UltraTech Cement ended as the top gainers in the Sensex index.On the flip side, shares of ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Asian Paints, Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech and Infosys ended as the top losers in the index.Barring Nifty IT (down 0.51 per cent), all sectoral indices ended higher, with Nifty PSU Bank (up 3.41 per cent), Realty (up 2.23 per cent), Oil \u0026 Gas (up 1.89 per cent), Auto (up 1.56 per cent) and Consumer Durables (up 1.18 per cent) clocking solid gains.The Nifty Bank index rose 0.58 per cent, while the Private Bank index climbed 0.22 per cent.\"The euphoria from the Fed rate cut continued to lift the domestic market. The benign input costs and an expectation of a change in stance by the RBI amid cuts by global banks will provide tailwinds to valuation. Though there is moderation in India PMI data, investors are anticipating that the wave of liquidity from FII may provide stability in the sentiment,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.Read all market-related news here","cleaned_content":"stocks at record highs nearly \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e stocks including mahindra and mahindra m m kotak mahindra bank hindustan unilever hul bharti airtel bajaj finserv and sun pharma hit their fresh \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e week highs in intraday trade on bse on monday september \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e amid an all round buying which boosted benchmarks the sensex and the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e to their fresh record levels shares of aadhar housing finance bajaj auto hero motocorp tvs motor apollo hospitals bajaj holdings cholamandalam investment and finance colgate palmolive india divis labs havells india naukri trent and zomato were also among the stocks that hit their one year highs indian stock market benchmarks the sensex and the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e extended gains into the third consecutive session despite mixed global cues the sensex hit its fresh record high of \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e while the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e made a fresh peak of \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e during the session the sensex finally closed \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e higher at \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e while the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e ended \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e up at \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e the mid and smallcap indices on the bse also saw significant gains rising by \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e each the across the board buying shot up the cumulative market capitalisation of the firms listed on the bse to \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED\u003e lakh crore from nearly \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED\u003e lakh crore in the previous session making investors richer by about \u003cFOUR_\u003e lakh crore in a single session shares of mahindra and mahindra sbi bharti airtel kotak mahindra bank hul and ultratech cement ended as the top gainers in the sensex index on the flip side shares of icici bank indusind bank asian paints tech mahindra hcl tech and infosys ended as the top losers in the index barring nifty it down \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e all sectoral indices ended higher with nifty psu bank up \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e realty up \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e oil gas up \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e auto up \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e and consumer durables up \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e clocking solid gains the nifty bank index rose \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e while the private bank index climbed \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e the euphoria from the fed rate cut continued to lift the domestic market the benign input costs and an expectation of a change in stance by the rbi amid cuts by global banks will provide tailwinds to valuation though there is moderation in india pmi data investors are anticipating that the wave of liquidity from fii may provide stability in the sentiment said vinod nair head of research geojit financial services read all market related news here","timestamp":"2024-09-23T16:28:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-24T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
