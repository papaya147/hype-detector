The benchmark Nifty touched a record high level of 25,849.25, while the Sensex hit a new high of 84,694.46 during the session.The Bank Nifty index also breached its previous highs after three months of consolidation and surpassed the 54,000 level on September 20. The index hit a fresh record high of 54,066.10. It closed 755.60 points, or 1.42%, higher at a new all time closing high level of 53,793.20.“Bank Nifty index is walking on the Upper Bollinger band showing signs of continued bullishness and has found support at the 52,000 levels. Last week’s low can act as a support which if sustained, the rally in the index can further go up to 55,000 levels,” said Rahul Ghose, CEO of Hedged.in.With the view on the upside, Ghose suggests a low-risk Bank Nifty Options strategy from hedged.in which makes money if the Bank Nifty trades above 54,200 by the end of 1st October expiry.“Even if the Bank Nifty does fall down or stays sideways, the maximum risk in the trade is Rs. 750,” Ghose said.Here’s Bank Nifty Options trading strategy for today by Rahul Ghose:\u003e Buy 1 lot of the 1st Oct expiry 54000 CE at CMP\u003e Sell 2 lots of the 1st Oct expiry 54300 CE at CMP\u003e Buy 1 lot of the 1st Oct expiry 54400 CE at CMPThe capital required in the trade is  ₹36,300.
