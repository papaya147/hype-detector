In the calendar year so far, FPI net investment stands at  ₹88,975 crore.“The MPC (Monetary Policy Committee), which was expected to cut the repo rate at its December meeting, would wait to see the impact of inflation, which will increase in the event of a full-blown Israel-Iran conflict,” said Holland of Avendus Capital.MPC meets on 7-9 October and 4-6 December this year.Rohit Srivastava, founder of IndiaCharts, said FII unwinding of long positions exacerbated Thursday's market fall.FIIs slashed their bullish index futures and index option bets (Nifty and Bank Nifty contracts) by 155,462 contracts and 182,794 contracts to 162,855 and 448,802 contracts, respectively, on Thursday, per NSE data.To close out a bullish or long position, one has to sell it .
