Acting as a one-stop provider, Krystal offers services like IFMS, security, staffing, and catering, streamlining client operations.With 77% of the revenue coming from government contracts and a 100% renewal rate in FY24, the brokerage believes Krystal is well-positioned to benefit from India’s infrastructure growth, bolstered by a strong private client base that includes HDFC Bank and Phoenix Mills.Additionally, Krystal’s robust B2B foundation and potential entry into the B2C market present significant revenue growth opportunities.The brokerage maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of  ₹1230 apiece, which indicates an upside potential of 66% for the stock from its latest closing price of  ₹742.The company debuted on the Indian secondary market in March, with a listing price of  ₹713, just slightly below its IPO price of  ₹715.
