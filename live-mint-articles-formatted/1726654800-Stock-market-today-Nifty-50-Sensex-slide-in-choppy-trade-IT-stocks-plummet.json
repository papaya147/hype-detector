The market experienced a tug-of-war between declining IT stocks and resilient financial shares. A sharp drop in IT stocks heavily impacted the market, pulling the frontline indices down. Additionally, pharmaceutical stocks also faced significant declines.However, strong support from financial stocks helped cushion the overall losses, mitigating the day’s market downturn.Amidst the volatility, the Nifty 50 concluded the session with a slight drop of 0.16 per cent, ending at 25,377 points. During trading, the index reached a new all-time high of 25,482 points, approaching the 25,500 level. Similarly, the S\u0026P BSE Sensex finished the day at 82,948 points, marking a 0.16 per cent decline from its previous close. The index also achieved a new record high of 83,326 points during the trade.Among the 50 Nifty constituents, 29 stocks ended in negative territory, with TCS leading with a 3.4 per cent drop. Other notable losers included Infosys, HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Bajaj Auto, Sun Pharmaceutical, and Tata Consumer Products, all of which dropped between 3.1 per cent and 1.5 per cent.On the other hand, small and midcap stocks underperformed the benchmark indices in Wednesday's trade. The Nifty Midcap 100 dropped to 59,752 points, a 0.71 per cent fall, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 index tumbled by 0.64 per cent to 19,389 points.Commenting on today's market performance, Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said, \"The Indian market experienced a minor profit booking with underperformance by midcaps. Mixed signals from global markets emerged ahead of the anticipated FOMC rate cut decision which is seemingly priced in a 25-bps cut.\"“Investors assess the potential for a short-term underperformance of equity given the elevated valuation and correction of metal prices. Commodities, including oil prices, are steadily declining, suggesting a potential tempering of economic growth. Investor caution is evident as gold prices rise, likely due to anticipated dollar weakness following the rate cut,” Nair added.The sharp drop in the large-cap IT stocks has led the Nifty IT index to plunge by 3.02 per cent to 41,814 points, falling below the 42,000 mark for the first time since September 9. Today's drop in the index was the biggest intraday drop in 6 weeks, and also this decline has pushed the index to a 2-week low.The significant decline in IT stocks observed today is mainly due to profit-taking by investors after a strong rally over recent months. Since June, IT stocks have experienced a bullish trend, with the Nifty IT index rising by 32 per cent from June to August, leading investors to lock in profits.This profit booking occurred ahead of the anticipated US Federal Reserve rate-reduction cycle, expected to start on September 18. With easing inflation and a cooling labour market in the US, investors are preparing for this policy shift. Market expectations had priced in a 25-basis point cut, with some anticipating a more substantial 50-basis point reduction, which analysts believe could spur a rally in stocks.Banking stocks surged sharply in today's trading as investors shifted their focus from the IT and pharmaceutical sectors to banking, which had been lagging behind. The Nifty Bank index ended the session with a 1.08 per cent gain, closing at 52,954 points, and hit a 10-week high during the day.Amit Goel, the co-founder and chief global strategist at Pace 360, believes the Fed rate cut will likely have a positive impact on banking stocks.\"Lower interest rates typically lead to increased borrowing activity, benefiting banks through higher loan demand and associated interest income. Additionally, lower rates can reduce the cost of funds for banks, improving their net interest margins. Moreover, lower interest rates can decrease the risk of loan defaults, enhancing the quality of banks' assets,\" Goel explained.","cleaned_content":"indian frontline indices remained range bound in volatile trading on wednesday as investors chose to stay cautious ahead of the crucial us federal reserve meeting where the announcement of the first rate cut in four years is anticipated the market experienced a tug of war between declining it stocks and resilient financial shares a sharp drop in it stocks heavily impacted the market pulling the frontline indices down additionally pharmaceutical stocks also faced significant declines however strong support from financial stocks helped cushion the overall losses mitigating the day s market downturn amidst the volatility the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e concluded the session with a slight drop of \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e ending at \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e points during trading the index reached a new all time high of \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e points approaching the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e level similarly the s p bse sensex finished the day at \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e points marking a \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e decline from its previous close the index also achieved a new record high of \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e points during the trade among the \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e nifty constituents \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e stocks ended in negative territory with tcs leading with a \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e drop other notable losers included infosys hcl technologies tech mahindra wipro bajaj auto sun pharmaceutical and tata consumer products all of which dropped between \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e and \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e on the other hand small and midcap stocks underperformed the benchmark indices in wednesdays trade the nifty midcap \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e dropped to \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e points a \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e fall while the nifty smallcap \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e index tumbled by \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e points commenting on todays market performance vinod nair head of research geojit financial services said the indian market experienced a minor profit booking with underperformance by midcaps mixed signals from global markets emerged ahead of the anticipated fomc rate cut decision which is seemingly priced in a \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e bps cut investors assess the potential for a short term underperformance of equity given the elevated valuation and correction of metal prices commodities including oil prices are steadily declining suggesting a potential tempering of economic growth investor caution is evident as gold prices rise likely due to anticipated dollar weakness following the rate cut nair added the sharp drop in the large cap it stocks has led the nifty it index to plunge by \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cFOUR_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e points falling below the \u003cFOUR_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark for the first time since september \u003cNINE_\u003e todays drop in the index was the biggest intraday drop in \u003cSIX_\u003e weeks and also this decline has pushed the index to a \u003cTWO_\u003e week low the significant decline in it stocks observed today is mainly due to profit taking by investors after a strong rally over recent months since june it stocks have experienced a bullish trend with the nifty it index rising by \u003cTHREE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e from june to august leading investors to lock in profits this profit booking occurred ahead of the anticipated us federal reserve rate reduction cycle expected to start on september \u003cONE_TEN\u003e with easing inflation and a cooling labour market in the us investors are preparing for this policy shift market expectations had priced in a \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e basis point cut with some anticipating a more substantial \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e basis point reduction which analysts believe could spur a rally in stocks banking stocks surged sharply in todays trading as investors shifted their focus from the it and pharmaceutical sectors to banking which had been lagging behind the nifty bank index ended the session with a \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e gain closing at \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e points and hit a \u003cONE_TEN\u003e week high during the day amit goel the co founder and chief global strategist at pace \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e believes the fed rate cut will likely have a positive impact on banking stocks lower interest rates typically lead to increased borrowing activity benefiting banks through higher loan demand and associated interest income additionally lower rates can reduce the cost of funds for banks improving their net interest margins moreover lower interest rates can decrease the risk of loan defaults enhancing the quality of banks assets goel explained","timestamp":"2024-09-18T15:50:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-19T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
