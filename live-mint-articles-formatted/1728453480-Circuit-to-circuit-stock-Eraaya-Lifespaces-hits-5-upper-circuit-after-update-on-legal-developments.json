This confusion and complication arising from Mr Raina's action prompted E\u0026Y to initiate legal proceedings against Ebix Singapore in the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi, the company said.\"Although a claim was filed by E\u0026Y, after the Eraaya and Ebix teams engaged with E\u0026Y and presented the true facts about the insolvency proceedings, E\u0026Y opted to withdraw their petition, and the matter has since been amicably resolved.
