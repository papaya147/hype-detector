Meanwhile, gold, as a safe-haven asset, gained further appeal amid escalating tensions in the Middle East and the prospect of lower interest rates,\" said Vinod Nair, the head of research at Geojit Financial Services.Read all market-related news here","cleaned_content":"stock market today as many as \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e stocks including mahindra and mahindra m m ntpc power grid bajaj finserv hindalco trent and tvs motor company hit their fresh one year highs in intraday trade on bse on wednesday september \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e even as benchmark indices the sensex and the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e scaled their fresh peaks amid mixed global cues bosch cg power and industrial solutions ipca labs tata communications united breweries blue star ceat craftsman automation eclerx services lloyds metals and energy and metropolis healthcare were also among the stocks that rose to their \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e week highs the stock market benchmark the sensex rose to a new high of \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e while the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e also scaled a fresh peak of \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e during the session thanks to fag end buying the sensex closed at \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e with a gain of \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e ended the day at \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e up \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e shares of axis bank hdfc bank power grid and icici bank contributed the most to the gains in the sensex index on the flip side shares of tata motors kotak mahindra bank tech mahindra and sbi ended as the top drags on the index however the market did not see broad based gains as the mid and small cap segments ended with losses the bse midcap and smallcap indices closed the day lower by \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e and \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e respectively the overall market capitalisation of the firms listed on the bse dropped to nearly \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED\u003e lakh crore from nearly \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED\u003e lakh crore in the previous session experts observe that investors are booking profit at higher levels due to valuation concerns even as the medium to long term outlook of the market remains positive due to the durability of indias economic growth and inflow of retail money the domestic market may face short term challenges owing to a decline in fiis inflow and shift of funds to other emerging markets due to their cheap valuation meanwhile gold as a safe haven asset gained further appeal amid escalating tensions in the middle east and the prospect of lower interest rates said vinod nair the head of research at geojit financial services read all market related news here","timestamp":"2024-09-25T16:08:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-26T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
