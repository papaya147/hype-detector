Mahanagar Gas (MGL) surged by 6.7 per cent, reaching a new record high of  ₹1,943 per share, while Indraprastha Gas (IGL) rose by 6.2 per cent, reaching  ₹562.75 per share.The rally was sparked by a revised outlook from global brokerage UBS, which upgraded its rating and target price for IGL and set a new record high target price for MGLThe brokerage has upgraded the rating on IGL to 'buy' from the previous rating of sell' and also lifted its target price from  ₹400 to  ₹700, which reflects an upside potential of 32.32% for the stock from its previous closing price.UBS emphasized that the company's strong near-term fundamentals are now supported by promising inorganic growth opportunities. The brokerage had previously been cautious about IGL due to slower volume growth in recent quarters and concerns about the risks associated with electrification.However, the brokerage now expects IGL's volume growth trajectory to improve, projecting an increase from 4 per cent year-on-year in FY24 to an 8.2 per cent CAGR between FY24 and FY27. UBS pointed to IGL’s expansion into new geographies and infrastructure development as key growth drivers, with potential mergers and acquisitions (M\u0026A) opportunities yet to be reflected in the stock price.Similarly, UBS has increased the target price for Mahanagar Gas (MGL) from  ₹1,600 to  ₹2,400 per share, which implies a potential upside of 32 per cent from the stock’s most recent closing price. It continued with its 'buy' recommendation on the stock.It raised its volume growth expectations for FY25 to FY27, forecasting an increase of 7 per cent to 11 per cent, anticipating that both organic and inorganic growth in volumes could exceed expectations. Infrastructure development and the expansion of CNG fleets are expected to drive this growth.It also lifted its EBITDA per standard cubic meter (scm) forecast for FY25-27 by 6-11 per cent to  ₹12.1-12.3/scm, factoring in MGL’s pricing strategies. Similar to IGL, potential M\u0026A opportunities have not yet been factored by the brokerage into MGL’s current stock price.In their Q1FY25 earnings report, both companies highlighted the launch of the world’s first CNG motorcycle by Bajaj Auto in early July. TVS Motors is also exploring the CNG scooter market, with a model expected to launch in the first half of CY25.While these innovations may open new growth avenues for city gas distribution companies (CGDs), the impact is likely to be more significant in the long term rather than the near term. Volume growth will depend on the adoption rate of CNG two-wheelers, which is expected to increase as more units become available on the roads.Bajaj Auto has started with an initial production of 20,000 units per month, beginning in Maharashtra and Gujarat, with plans to expand to other states in the coming quarter.In Q1 FY25, Mahanagar Gas reported a capital expenditure of  ₹2.5 billion. The company plans to add over 50 new CNG stations at a standalone level and approximately 25 stations in UEPL’s geographical area during FY25.Indraprastha Gas has projected a capital expenditure of  ₹17-18 billion for FY25. In Q1FY25, IGL's capex was about  ₹3 billion, compared to  ₹2 billion in the same quarter of the previous year.","cleaned_content":"despite front line indices trading within a narrow range during tuesdays session shares of city gas distribution companies mahanagar gas and indraprastha gas experienced notable gains mahanagar gas mgl surged by \u003cSIX_PERCENT\u003e reaching a new record high of \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e per share while indraprastha gas igl rose by \u003cSIX_PERCENT\u003e reaching \u003cFIVE_HUNDRED\u003e per share the rally was sparked by a revised outlook from global brokerage ubs which upgraded its rating and target price for igl and set a new record high target price for mglthe brokerage has upgraded the rating on igl to buy from the previous rating of sell and also lifted its target price from \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED\u003e to \u003cSEVEN_HUNDRED\u003e which reflects an upside potential of \u003cTHREE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e for the stock from its previous closing price ubs emphasized that the companys strong near term fundamentals are now supported by promising inorganic growth opportunities the brokerage had previously been cautious about igl due to slower volume growth in recent quarters and concerns about the risks associated with electrification however the brokerage now expects igls volume growth trajectory to improve projecting an increase from \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e year on year in fy24 to an \u003cEIGHT_PERCENT\u003e cagr between fy24 and fy27 ubs pointed to igl s expansion into new geographies and infrastructure development as key growth drivers with potential mergers and acquisitions m a opportunities yet to be reflected in the stock price similarly ubs has increased the target price for mahanagar gas mgl from \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e to \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e per share which implies a potential upside of \u003cTHREE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e from the stock s most recent closing price it continued with its buy recommendation on the stock it raised its volume growth expectations for fy25 to fy27 forecasting an increase of \u003cSEVEN_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e anticipating that both organic and inorganic growth in volumes could exceed expectations infrastructure development and the expansion of cng fleets are expected to drive this growth it also lifted its ebitda per standard cubic meter scm forecast for fy25 \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e by \u003cSIX_\u003e \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cONE_TEN\u003e \u003cONE_TEN\u003e scm factoring in mgl s pricing strategies similar to igl potential m a opportunities have not yet been factored by the brokerage into mgl s current stock price in their q1fy25 earnings report both companies highlighted the launch of the world s first cng motorcycle by bajaj auto in early july tvs motors is also exploring the cng scooter market with a model expected to launch in the first half of cy25 while these innovations may open new growth avenues for city gas distribution companies cgds the impact is likely to be more significant in the long term rather than the near term volume growth will depend on the adoption rate of cng two wheelers which is expected to increase as more units become available on the roads bajaj auto has started with an initial production of \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e units per month beginning in maharashtra and gujarat with plans to expand to other states in the coming quarter in q1 fy25 mahanagar gas reported a capital expenditure of \u003cTWO_\u003e billion the company plans to add over \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e new cng stations at a standalone level and approximately \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e stations in uepl s geographical area during fy25 indraprastha gas has projected a capital expenditure of \u003cONE_TEN\u003e \u003cONE_TEN\u003e billion for fy25 in q1fy25 igls capex was about \u003cTHREE_\u003e billion compared to \u003cTWO_\u003e billion in the same quarter of the previous year","timestamp":"2024-09-17T12:09:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-17T12:09:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
