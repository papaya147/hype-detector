BPCL also remains top gainers in Nifty-50 stocks","content":"Stock Market Today: The Nifty Oil \u0026 Gas index gained up to 2.5% during the intraday trade on Friday, September 27. Oil marketing companies (OMCs) such as Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation ( IOCL) rose up to 7% and were the lead gainers. BPCL share price also scaled its one-year high and was the top gainer among Nifty50 stocks.Gujarat Gas, Petronet LNG, Gujarat State Petronet, and GAIL (India) were other key gainers in the index.The decline in crude oil prices lead the gains for oil marketing companies.Brent crude prices that were at close to $90 a barrel and even higher in April 2024 are trading close to $70 a barrel levels. Notably, the crude prices are down around 8% in the last one week.The lower crude prices bode well for the marketing margins of OMCs. Marketing margins are the profits that these companies make by selling auto fuels at their outlets and hence lower costs of crude oil bode well for these margins.Against the backdrop of weak crude oil prices and a range-bound refining GRM environment, the outlook for marketing margins remains strong, said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.Also, they added that OMCs appear to be trading at the higher end of the historical range, with Street's earnings estimates at only  ₹3-4 per litre marketing margins while current margins are above  ₹10 a litre.These should address concerns not only on the valuations at which OMCs may be trading at but also on any fuel price cuts that OMCs may be asked to undertake ahead of state elections.,","cleaned_content":"stock market today the nifty oil gas index gained up to \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e during the intraday trade on friday september \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e oil marketing companies omcs such as bharat petroleum corporation ltd bpcl hindustan petroleum corporation ltd hpcl and indian oil corporation iocl rose up to \u003cSEVEN_PERCENT\u003e and were the lead gainers bpcl share price also scaled its one year high and was the top gainer among nifty50 stocks gujarat gas petronet lng gujarat state petronet and gail india were other key gainers in the index the decline in crude oil prices lead the gains for oil marketing companies brent crude prices that were at close to \u003cNINE_TEN\u003e a barrel and even higher in april \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e are trading close to \u003cSEVEN_TEN\u003e a barrel levels notably the crude prices are down around \u003cEIGHT_PERCENT\u003e in the last one week the lower crude prices bode well for the marketing margins of omcs marketing margins are the profits that these companies make by selling auto fuels at their outlets and hence lower costs of crude oil bode well for these margins against the backdrop of weak crude oil prices and a range bound refining grm environment the outlook for marketing margins remains strong said analysts at motilal oswal financial services also they added that omcs appear to be trading at the higher end of the historical range with streets earnings estimates at only \u003cTHREE_\u003e \u003cFOUR_\u003e per litre marketing margins while current margins are above \u003cONE_TEN\u003e a litre these should address concerns not only on the valuations at which omcs may be trading at but also on any fuel price cuts that omcs may be asked to undertake ahead of state elections","timestamp":"2024-09-27T15:08:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-27T15:08:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
