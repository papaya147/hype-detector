This significant erosion in value came as the broader market faced severe headwinds, with the BSE benchmark index plunging by 3,883.4 points, or 4.53 per cent, in a holiday-shortened trading week, as per PTI report.The downturn was primarily attributed to escalating tensions in the Middle East and a notable exodus of foreign funds from Indian equities. Among the hardest hit was Reliance Industries, India's most valuable company, which saw its market value shrink by  ₹1,88,479.36 crore to  ₹18,76,718.24 crore, the report added.HDFC Bank, another heavyweight, wasn't spared either, with its valuation dropping by  ₹72,919.58 crore to  ₹12,64,267.35 crore. Bharti Airtel and ICICI Bank also felt the heat, losing  ₹53,800.31 crore and  ₹47,461.13 crore in market cap, respectively, as per the report.Other major corporations facing significant devaluations included Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), Hindustan Unilever, ITC, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). State Bank of India saw a comparatively smaller dip of  ₹5,399.39 crore in its market value.Interestingly, Infosys emerged as the sole gainer among the top ten, with its market capitalization increasing by  ₹4,629.64 crore to reach  ₹7,96,527.08 crore.Despite the substantial losses, the pecking order of India's most valuable companies remained largely unchanged. Reliance Industries maintained its top position, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, Bharti Airtel, and ICICI Bank rounding out the top five.This market turbulence serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities in even the most robust economies to global geopolitical events and shifting investor sentiments. As the situation continues to evolve, market watchers will be keenly observing how these corporate giants navigate through these challenging times.(With inputs from PTI)","cleaned_content":"in a tumultuous week for indian markets nine out of the top ten most valuable companies in india saw their market capitalization plummet by a staggering \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED_THOUSAND\u003e crore this significant erosion in value came as the broader market faced severe headwinds with the bse benchmark index plunging by \u003cTHREE_THOUSAND\u003e points or \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e in a holiday shortened trading week as per pti report the downturn was primarily attributed to escalating tensions in the middle east and a notable exodus of foreign funds from indian equities among the hardest hit was reliance industries indias most valuable company which saw its market value shrink by \u003cONE_HUNDRED_THOUSAND\u003e crore to \u003cONE_MILLION\u003e crore the report added hdfc bank another heavyweight wasnt spared either with its valuation dropping by \u003cSEVEN_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore to \u003cONE_MILLION\u003e crore bharti airtel and icici bank also felt the heat losing \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore and \u003cFOUR_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore in market cap respectively as per the report other major corporations facing significant devaluations included life insurance corporation of india lic hindustan unilever itc and tata consultancy services tcs state bank of india saw a comparatively smaller dip of \u003cFIVE_THOUSAND\u003e crore in its market value interestingly infosys emerged as the sole gainer among the top ten with its market capitalization increasing by \u003cFOUR_THOUSAND\u003e crore to reach \u003cSEVEN_HUNDRED_THOUSAND\u003e crore despite the substantial losses the pecking order of indias most valuable companies remained largely unchanged reliance industries maintained its top position followed by tcs hdfc bank bharti airtel and icici bank rounding out the top five this market turbulence serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities in even the most robust economies to global geopolitical events and shifting investor sentiments as the situation continues to evolve market watchers will be keenly observing how these corporate giants navigate through these challenging times with inputs from pti","timestamp":"2024-10-06T11:13:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-07T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
