The Mukesh Ambani-owned company has already informed the Indian stock market exchanges about the board meeting date to declare its quarterly results for the Q2FY25.According to stock market experts, Reliance Industries Q2 results in 2024 are expected to remain 'muted'. However, they said a dip in Reliance share price should be seen as a buying opportunity as RIL share price has already faced a considerable correction in recent sessions.On the market expectations regarding RIL Q2 results 2024, Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investment and Securities, said, “Reliance Industries' Board is set to meet on October 14, 2024, to review and approve its financial results for the quarter and half-year ending September 30. In the June 2024 quarter, the company reported a 2% year-on-year EBITDA growth to  ₹42,748 crore, though net profit saw a 5% decline, landing at  ₹15,138 crore.\"\"With the upcoming results, expectations are for a muted or flat performance. However, given that Reliance's stock has already faced significant correction from higher levels, any dip following the results could present a strong opportunity for long-term investors. Additionally, any positive surprises in the numbers could trigger a sharp upside in the stock,” Anshul Jain said.What does the technical chart suggest about Reliance's share price outlook? Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, said, \"Reliance Industries' stock is currently trading around  ₹2744, showing a slight increase of +2.10 points. The stock has dropped below its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages ( ₹2925.94,  ₹2934.39, and  ₹2865.69).\"The Choice Broking expert said that RIL's share price has fallen from its  ₹3200 high and is finding support at  ₹2700. If this level breaks, the next support could be around  ₹2650. On the upside, resistance lies between  ₹2900 and  ₹2950, which may trigger a bullish move if the stock breaks above this range.\"The short-term trend is bearish, but it may stabilise if the stock holds above the 200-day moving average. Traders should watch the  ₹2700 support and  ₹2888 resistance closely for signs of the stock's next move. A break beyond these levels will provide a clearer direction for Reliance's stock,\" said Bagadia.","cleaned_content":"reliance share price shares of reliance industries ltd ril will be in focus today as the company board has set a meeting on \u003cONE_TEN\u003e th october \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e to consider and approve the standalone q2 results \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e of the sensex heavyweight the mukesh ambani owned company has already informed the indian stock market exchanges about the board meeting date to declare its quarterly results for the q2fy25 according to stock market experts reliance industries q2 results in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e are expected to remain muted however they said a dip in reliance share price should be seen as a buying opportunity as ril share price has already faced a considerable correction in recent sessions on the market expectations regarding ril q2 results \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e anshul jain head of research at lakshmishree investment and securities said reliance industries board is set to meet on october \u003cONE_TEN\u003e \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e to review and approve its financial results for the quarter and half year ending september \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e in the june \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e quarter the company reported a \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e year on year ebitda growth to \u003cFOUR_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore though net profit saw a \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e decline landing at \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore with the upcoming results expectations are for a muted or flat performance however given that reliances stock has already faced significant correction from higher levels any dip following the results could present a strong opportunity for long term investors additionally any positive surprises in the numbers could trigger a sharp upside in the stock anshul jain said what does the technical chart suggest about reliances share price outlook sumeet bagadia executive director at choice broking said reliance industries stock is currently trading around \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e showing a slight increase of \u003cTWO_\u003e points the stock has dropped below its \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e day \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e day and \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e day moving averages \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e and \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e the choice broking expert said that rils share price has fallen from its \u003cTHREE_THOUSAND\u003e high and is finding support at \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e if this level breaks the next support could be around \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e on the upside resistance lies between \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e and \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e which may trigger a bullish move if the stock breaks above this range the short term trend is bearish but it may stabilise if the stock holds above the \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e day moving average traders should watch the \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e support and \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e resistance closely for signs of the stocks next move a break beyond these levels will provide a clearer direction for reliances stock said bagadia","timestamp":"2024-10-14T06:33:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-14T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
