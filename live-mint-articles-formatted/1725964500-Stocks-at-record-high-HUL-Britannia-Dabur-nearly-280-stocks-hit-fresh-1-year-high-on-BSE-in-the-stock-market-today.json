On the other hand, shares of Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance and Hindustan Unilever ended as the top losers in the index.The Nifty 50 closed 105 points, or 0.42 per cent, higher at 25,041.10, with 34 stocks in the green.The market saw broad-based gains as the midcap and small-cap segments also ended with healthy gains.

Both these numbers are crucial and can influence the Fed's interest rate decisions.\"The domestic market showcased a gradual rebound driven by the shift in focus towards upcoming US inflation and potential Fed policy stance. The US political risk and recession fears may set near-term cautious sentiments in the global market. On the domestic front, a strong monsoon and an expectation of an uptick in demand during the festival season will drive investor sentiment,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Read all market-related news here","cleaned_content":"stocks at record high the indian stock market witnessed healthy gains on tuesday september \u003cONE_TEN\u003e as some \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e stocks including hindustan unilever hul dabur and britannia industries hit their fresh \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e week highs in intraday trade on the bse divis laboratories avenue supermarts dmart indian hotels company pi industries shriram finance and united spirits were also among the stocks that hit their one year highs on the bse market benchmarks the sensex and the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e closed with decent gains led by select heavyweights across segments such as bharti airtel infosys tcs axis bank and ntpc the sensex closed with a gain of \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e at \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e with shares of hcl tech bharti airtel and tech mahindra as the top gainers on the other hand shares of bajaj finserv bajaj finance and hindustan unilever ended as the top losers in the index the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e closed \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e higher at \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e with \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e stocks in the green the market saw broad based gains as the midcap and small cap segments also ended with healthy gains the bse midcap index rose \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e and the smallcap index jumped \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e the overall market capitalisation of bse listed forms rose to nearly \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED\u003e lakh crore from nearly \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED\u003e lakh crore in the previous session making investors richer by over \u003cTHREE_\u003e lakh crore in a single session the big event for the market is the us fomc federal open market committee meeting next week september \u003cONE_TEN\u003e \u003cONE_TEN\u003e in which the us central bank is expected to cut the interest rates by \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e bps at the current juncture investors focus is on the us consumer price index cpi data on wednesday and the producer price index ppi prints on thursday both these numbers are crucial and can influence the feds interest rate decisions the domestic market showcased a gradual rebound driven by the shift in focus towards upcoming us inflation and potential fed policy stance the us political risk and recession fears may set near term cautious sentiments in the global market on the domestic front a strong monsoon and an expectation of an uptick in demand during the festival season will drive investor sentiment said vinod nair head of research at geojit financial services read all market related news here","timestamp":"2024-09-10T16:05:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-11T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
