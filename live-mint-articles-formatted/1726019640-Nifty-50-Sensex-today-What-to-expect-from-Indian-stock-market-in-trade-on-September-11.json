The Gift Nifty was trading around 25,089 level, a discount of nearly 10 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close.On Tuesday, the domestic equity market indices ended higher, with the benchmark Nifty 50 closing above the 25,000 level.The Sensex gained 361.75 points, or 0.44%, to close at 81,921.29, while the Nifty 50 settled 104.70 points, or 0.42%, higher at 25,041.10.Nifty 50 formed a small positive candle on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadows.“Technically, this pattern indicates a formation of a doji type candle pattern, which is not a classical one. Normally, such a doji pattern at the hurdle indicates caution for bulls. The short-term trend of Nifty 50 seems to have reversed up and the index is currently placed at the crucial resistance of 25,200 levels,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.According to him, a decisive move above this hurdle could only open further upside towards the new all-time highs.Here’s what to expect from Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today:Nifty 50 continued with follow through upmove on September 10 amidst volatility and closed the day higher by 104 points above the 25,000-mark.“Nifty remained volatile throughout the day, unable to sustain levels above 25,100. The RSI remained in a bearish crossover on the daily timeframe, indicating continued weakness. Sentiment is expected to stay weak in the near term unless Nifty manages a close above 25,100,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.On the lower side, he believes support is seen at 24,900 and if breached, the index may decline further towards 24,750.Aditya Agarwal, Head of Derivatives and Technical at Sanctum Wealth is of the view that the Nifty 50 index will continue to find stiff resistance around 25,100 - 25,150 and can see profit booking from those levels. On the lower side, he believes dip towards 24,940 - 24,880 can be used as a buying opportunity.According to VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today, the Nifty index could expect support levels around 25,010 and 24,920, whereas resistance could be between 25,165 and 25,205 in today’s session.Bank Nifty index closed 154.50 points, or 0.3%, higher at 51,272.30 on Tuesday, holding above a piercing line candle on the daily chart.“On the higher side, Bank Nifty will continue to find strong resistance around 51,500 / 51,700 levels and can see profit booking around those levels. Only a close above 51,800 will change short term outlook in the index and in that scenario, it can move towards 52,280 / 52,460 levels,” Agarwal said.On the lower side, he believes 51,000 - 50,700 will act as a support zone for the Bank Nifty index.","cleaned_content":"indian stock market benchmark indices sensex and nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e are likely to open on a tepid note wednesday following mixed global market cues the trends on gift nifty also indicate a flat to negative start for the indian benchmark index the gift nifty was trading around \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e level a discount of nearly \u003cONE_TEN\u003e points from the nifty futures previous close on tuesday the domestic equity market indices ended higher with the benchmark nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e closing above the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e level the sensex gained \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e to close at \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e while the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e settled \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e higher at \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e formed a small positive candle on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadows technically this pattern indicates a formation of a doji type candle pattern which is not a classical one normally such a doji pattern at the hurdle indicates caution for bulls the short term trend of nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e seems to have reversed up and the index is currently placed at the crucial resistance of \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e levels said nagaraj shetti senior technical research analyst at hdfc securities according to him a decisive move above this hurdle could only open further upside towards the new all time highs here s what to expect from nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e and bank nifty today nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e continued with follow through upmove on september \u003cONE_TEN\u003e amidst volatility and closed the day higher by \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e points above the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark nifty remained volatile throughout the day unable to sustain levels above \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e the rsi remained in a bearish crossover on the daily timeframe indicating continued weakness sentiment is expected to stay weak in the near term unless nifty manages a close above \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e said rupak de senior technical analyst at lkp securities on the lower side he believes support is seen at \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e and if breached the index may decline further towards \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e aditya agarwal head of derivatives and technical at sanctum wealth is of the view that the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e index will continue to find stiff resistance around \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e and can see profit booking from those levels on the lower side he believes dip towards \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e can be used as a buying opportunity according to vla ambala co founder of stock market today the nifty index could expect support levels around \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e and \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e whereas resistance could be between \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e and \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e in today s session bank nifty index closed \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e higher at \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e on tuesday holding above a piercing line candle on the daily chart on the higher side bank nifty will continue to find strong resistance around \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e levels and can see profit booking around those levels only a close above \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e will change short term outlook in the index and in that scenario it can move towards \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e levels agarwal said on the lower side he believes \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e will act as a support zone for the bank nifty index","timestamp":"2024-09-11T07:24:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-11T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
