While Materials, Energy, and Financials are likely to drag the aggregate net profit growth of Nifty to 5%, other sectors are expected to post a healthy high-teen growth.The consensus forecasts for FY25 Nifty EPS (Earnings Per Share) growth are resilient at 15.9%, said Seshadri Sen, Head Of Research And Strategist at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. He expects the volatility in the markets to continue for a few more quarters and advises long-term investors to buy into this weakness with a horizon of more than two years.The topline growth for companies under Emkay Global universe is estimated to remain muted at 3% YoY, with near-zero net profit growth.“This has been dragged by cement (due to an unusually pronounced seasonality) and Energy companies (due to a high base, which normalizes in 2HFY25). The rest of our universe reports a healthier 7.7% YoY topline growth and 12.7% YoY PAT growth,” Sen said.The trends are similar for consensus Nifty estimates, with 3% topline contraction and 9% net profit growth. Despite the weak topline, margins are forecast to improve by 140 bps to 20.2% for Nifty 50 companies, ex-BFSI.The consensus Nifty FY25 EPS has been steady at  ₹1,134, a growth of 15.9% YoY, despite the weak headline H1. Around 67.5% of the top-350 companies by Emkay coverage were in the stable zone of EPS forecasts (-5% to +10% change) in 2QFY25 versus 65.4% in Q1FY25.Sen believes the two downside risks to earnings are crude prices staying at or above $80 per barrel and a 50 bps RBI repo rate cut in Q3FY25, putting bank earnings at risk.Consumer Discretionary and Industrials sectors are expected to report relatively strong Q1 numbers, but that is largely in the price, and forward guidance and commentary will carry greater weight than the Q2FY25 earnings reports, according to Emkay Global.Materials (led by cement), Energy, and Financials are expected to be the negative outliers.Hindustan Unilever, oil marketing companies, and select midcap IT names like Eclerx Services could see a positive reaction after the results, while Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, and Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) are vulnerable to post-result corrections, Sen said.The Indian stock market is expected to remain rangebound with heightened volatility. According to the Emkay Global, the upside is capped by valuations as its September 2025 target for the Nifty 50, at a generous 22x PER 1-Year Forward, is 26,000 and offers less than 5% upside from here.“The downside is also protected, we believe, by sustained earnings growth and unprecedented macro-financial stability. The recent market sell-off is unlikely to translate into a major correction for broader indices. The big negatives - an oil shock from the Middle-East conflict and diversion of FPI flows to China - are transient, in our view,” Sen said.On October 9, the Reserve Bank of India’ (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 6.5%, but changed the policy stance to ‘Neutral’ from ‘Withdrawal of Accommodation’.According to Sen, RBI’s decision to hold rates will have little impact, while the turn in liquidity stance is a positive, he sees the easing cycle commencing in the December MPC meeting.“The interregnum (easier liquidity and rates on hold) is a sweet spot for banks, as it notionally helps liabilities without triggering loan yield cuts. Stocks could react positively if the market sees rate cuts getting delayed, with HDFC Bank benefiting the most. We would see that as purely a short term trade though, and use it to lighten positions in the BFSI sector,” Sen said.For the broader markets, he believes the rate easing cycle is in the price and unlikely to trigger a major move.Read TCS Q2 Results Live Updates here","cleaned_content":"the corporate earnings for the second quarter of fy25 are expected to be muted with high sector divergence and the stock market volatility will continue in the near future analysts said while materials energy and financials are likely to drag the aggregate net profit growth of nifty to \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e other sectors are expected to post a healthy high teen growth the consensus forecasts for fy25 nifty eps earnings per share growth are resilient at \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e said seshadri sen head of research and strategist at emkay global financial services ltd he expects the volatility in the markets to continue for a few more quarters and advises long term investors to buy into this weakness with a horizon of more than two years the topline growth for companies under emkay global universe is estimated to remain muted at \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e yoy with near zero net profit growth this has been dragged by cement due to an unusually pronounced seasonality and energy companies due to a high base which normalizes in \u003cTWO_\u003e hfy25 the rest of our universe reports a healthier \u003cSEVEN_PERCENT\u003e yoy topline growth and \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e yoy pat growth sen said the trends are similar for consensus nifty estimates with \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e topline contraction and \u003cNINE_PERCENT\u003e net profit growth despite the weak topline margins are forecast to improve by \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e bps to \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e for nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e companies ex bfsi the consensus nifty fy25 eps has been steady at \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e a growth of \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e yoy despite the weak headline h1 around \u003cSIX_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of the top \u003cTHREE_HUNDRED\u003e companies by emkay coverage were in the stable zone of eps forecasts \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e change in \u003cTWO_\u003e qfy25 versus \u003cSIX_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in q1fy25 sen believes the two downside risks to earnings are crude prices staying at or above \u003cEIGHT_TEN\u003e per barrel and a \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e bps rbi repo rate cut in q3fy25 putting bank earnings at risk consumer discretionary and industrials sectors are expected to report relatively strong q1 numbers but that is largely in the price and forward guidance and commentary will carry greater weight than the q2fy25 earnings reports according to emkay global materials led by cement energy and financials are expected to be the negative outliers hindustan unilever oil marketing companies and select midcap it names like eclerx services could see a positive reaction after the results while tata consultancy services tcs aditya birla fashion and retail and zee entertainment enterprises zeel are vulnerable to post result corrections sen said the indian stock market is expected to remain rangebound with heightened volatility according to the emkay global the upside is capped by valuations as its september \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e target for the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e at a generous \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e x per \u003cONE_\u003e year forward is \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e and offers less than \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e upside from here the downside is also protected we believe by sustained earnings growth and unprecedented macro financial stability the recent market sell off is unlikely to translate into a major correction for broader indices the big negatives an oil shock from the middle east conflict and diversion of fpi flows to china are transient in our view sen said on october \u003cNINE_\u003e the reserve bank of india rbi monetary policy committee mpc decided to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged at \u003cSIX_PERCENT\u003e but changed the policy stance to neutral from withdrawal of accommodation according to sen rbi s decision to hold rates will have little impact while the turn in liquidity stance is a positive he sees the easing cycle commencing in the december mpc meeting the interregnum easier liquidity and rates on hold is a sweet spot for banks as it notionally helps liabilities without triggering loan yield cuts stocks could react positively if the market sees rate cuts getting delayed with hdfc bank benefiting the most we would see that as purely a short term trade though and use it to lighten positions in the bfsi sector sen said for the broader markets he believes the rate easing cycle is in the price and unlikely to trigger a major move read tcs q2 results live updates here","timestamp":"2024-10-10T12:24:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-10T12:24:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
