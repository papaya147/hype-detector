D-Street experts say the Nifty 50 stares the 26,000 mark as its next upside.","content":"The Indian stock market registered an exceptional week, achieving historic record highs largely driven by a 50-basis-point (bps) rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, showing no significant concerns about the US economy. In the last week of September, investors will closely monitor key market triggers such as domestic and global macroeconomic data, monthly derivates expiry, foreign fund inflows, crude oil prices, and other global cues.Domestic equity benchmarks Nifty 50 and Sensex continued their upward momentum for the second consecutive week, hitting all-time highs of 25,849.25 and 84,694.46, respectively. Bulls took control of markets, and the rally was supported by the US Fed's supersized rate cut, its first policy reduction in four years. This whetted investor risk appetite across global markets.Also Read: Super FMCGs! Mrs Bectors to Jyothy Labs—LKP bets on 3 consumer staples over robust volume, eyes 20-30% returnsThe 50-basis-points rate cut on Wednesday and data showing smaller-than-expected weekly jobless claims on Thursday sparked hopes of the US economy achieving a soft landing. In this scenario, inflation cools without triggering a recession. Historically, rate cuts in the US have positively impacted emerging markets, with India being a favoured bet among global investors.Throughout most of the week, the indices traded within a limited range, but a strong rally on Friday helped Nifty and Sensex close at record highs, reaching 25,790.90 and 84,544.31, respectively. The rally was primarily driven by positive sentiment in global markets following the US Fed's decision.For the week, the NSE Nifty 50 and the 30-share BSE Sensex gained 1.7 per cent and two per cent, respectively, logging their fifth week of gains in six. Among sectoral indices, the construction or realty sector emerged as the top performer, followed by banking and financials, while the pharmaceutical sector ended the week in negative territory. Interestingly, the usually strong IT index underperformed, ending the week with a 2.75 per cent decline.Also Read: US Fed delivers supersized 50 bps rate cut: FPI inflows to stronger INR—here’s how the verdict is ‘good’ for India“The apprehension of a slowdown in growth was eased slightly after the lower-than-expected US jobless claim. The data pointed to a soft landing of the US economy at the start of the rate cut cycle. However, the IT index failed to rebound, mainly due to layoffs and the depreciation of USD. Strong monsoon and festive demand cheer the auto index with an outperformance,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services“We have seen a sectorial rotation among investors to large caps, especially in consumption, staples, auto, finance, and realty. In the short term, investors are being cautious about export-oriented sectors like pharma and IT due to depreciation in the dollar,” added Nair.Bank Nifty, which had lagged, took the lead, gaining 3.5 per cent and finally reaching its all-time high. The broader market indices underperformed, with the domestically focused midcap index posting marginal gains and the smallcap index falling by nearly one per cent.Also Read: Stocks to buy: HCL Tech to BPCL—Stoxbox lists top seven ’star stocks’ to bet on in September; Check entry point, TP\"The market displayed clear signs of sector rotation as investors shifted focus to sectors with renewed momentum.

The US Federal Reserve's move to cut interest rates by half a percentage point, its first reduction in over four years, provided a significant boost to markets.Though the global economy went through a rate-cut cycle, the Bank of England (BoE) stuck to a cautious tone and kept the rate unchanged, citing inflation pressure. On the other hand, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) kept its rate unchanged as expected, as the central bank adopted a wait-and-watch approach after raising the interest rate in July.Also Read: US Fed lowers policy rate by 50 bps from 23-year high, signals additional 50 bps cuts; 5 key takeawaysAccording to analysts, no major triggers are expected this week, but upcoming macroeconomic data from the US will be crucial to monitor.
