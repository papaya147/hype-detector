That's why the telecom stock is nosediving today,” Srivastava added.Earlier this month, foreign brokerage firm Goldman Sachs maintained a ‘Sell’ rating on Vodafone Idea shares and predicted a target price of  ₹2.5 apiece for the stock. The brokerage’s target on Vodafone Idea stock implied a sharp downfall of 83% from the prevailing price at that time.“Vodafone Idea has large AGR/spectrum related payments starting in FY26; while the government has the option of converting some dues into equity, we estimate ARPUs would have to rise by  ₹200-270 (120%-150% under different scenarios) versus December 2024E levels for Vodafone Idea to be sustainably free cash flow neutral, a low probability in the medium term in our view,” Goldman Sachs said in a report.Excluding the impact from any such potential conversion, it expects FCF to be negative at least until FY31.However, brokerages seem to be divided on Vodafone Idea shares as the target prices range from as low as  ₹1.50 by Deutsche Bank, to as high as  ₹23 per share from Ambit Capital.According to Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investment and Securities, Vodafone Idea share price has immediate support placed at  ₹11.50 apiece.“So, those who own Vodafone Idea shares are advised to maintain a strict stop loss below the  ₹11.50 per share mark and try to exit the stock if there is any relief rally. However, if the stock breaks down below  ₹11.50 on a closing basis, we may see the stock touching  ₹5.90 to  ₹5.70 apiece in the short to medium term,” Jain said.At 12:00 pm, Vodafone Idea shares were locked in at 15% lower circuit at  ₹10.96 apiece, while Bharti Airtel shares were trading 0.65% higher at  ₹1,665.65 apiece on NSE.","cleaned_content":"vodafone idea share price cracked \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e after the supreme court rejected a plea by telecom companies on re computation of adjusted gross revenues agr dues telcos including bharti airtel and vodafone idea had filed curative petitions citing arithmetic errors in computation of the agr demand by the government however in a setback for telcos the apex court bench comprising chief justice dy chandrachud and justices sanjiv khanna and br gavai on thursday rejected the batch of pleas on re computation of agr dues the curative petitions by the telcos urged the supreme court to reconsider its \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e judgement in favour of the department of telecommunications dot order seeking agr and other non revenue related dues telcos claimed that dot made a grave error in the calculation of agr dues and thus imposed arbitrary penalty amounts vodafone idea shares have already been trading weak after a global brokerage recently gave a sell call on the telecom stock giving a downside target of \u003cTWO_\u003e to \u003cTWO_\u003e per share noted seema srivastava senior equity analyst at smc global securities now the supreme court rejecting the telecom company s plea to re compute the adjusted gross revenue agr has further damaged the chances of recovery in vodafone idea shares thats why the telecom stock is nosediving today srivastava added earlier this month foreign brokerage firm goldman sachs maintained a sell rating on vodafone idea shares and predicted a target price of \u003cTWO_\u003e apiece for the stock the brokerage s target on vodafone idea stock implied a sharp downfall of \u003cEIGHT_TEN_PERCENT\u003e from the prevailing price at that time vodafone idea has large agr spectrum related payments starting in fy26 while the government has the option of converting some dues into equity we estimate arpus would have to rise by \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e \u003cONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e \u003cONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT\u003e under different scenarios versus december \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e e levels for vodafone idea to be sustainably free cash flow neutral a low probability in the medium term in our view goldman sachs said in a report excluding the impact from any such potential conversion it expects fcf to be negative at least until fy31 however brokerages seem to be divided on vodafone idea shares as the target prices range from as low as \u003cONE_\u003e by deutsche bank to as high as \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e per share from ambit capital according to anshul jain head of research at lakshmishree investment and securities vodafone idea share price has immediate support placed at \u003cONE_TEN\u003e apiece so those who own vodafone idea shares are advised to maintain a strict stop loss below the \u003cONE_TEN\u003e per share mark and try to exit the stock if there is any relief rally however if the stock breaks down below \u003cONE_TEN\u003e on a closing basis we may see the stock touching \u003cFIVE_\u003e to \u003cFIVE_\u003e apiece in the short to medium term jain said at \u003cONE_TEN\u003e \u003cZERO_\u003e pm vodafone idea shares were locked in at \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e lower circuit at \u003cONE_TEN\u003e apiece while bharti airtel shares were trading \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e higher at \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e apiece on nse","timestamp":"2024-09-19T11:54:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-19T11:54:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
