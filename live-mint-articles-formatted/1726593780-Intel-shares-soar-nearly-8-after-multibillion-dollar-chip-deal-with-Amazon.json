It fell below $100 billion for the first time in three decades this year.On Monday, Intel also announced that it is eligible to receive as much as $3 billion in US government funding to manufacture chips for the military.The effort, called the Secure Enclave, aims to establish a steady supply of cutting-edge chips for defense and intelligence purposes.Intel also said that it will halt fab projects in Poland and Germany for about two years, raising doubts about the nearly 10 billion euros ($11.14 billion) in subsidies from Germany for its two plants in the country.The chipmaker is also looking to speed up efforts to execute the $10 billion in cost savings and focus its products better on AI computing.","cleaned_content":"shares of intel corp soared as much as \u003cEIGHT_PERCENT\u003e on tuesday after a chip making deal with amazons cloud business was announced at \u003cONE_\u003e \u003cEIGHT_\u003e pm edt intel shares were at \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e up \u003cZERO_\u003e or \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e on monday intel shares had gained \u003cSIX_PERCENT\u003e the deal provides some respite to intels investors as the chipmaker s shares had fallen nearly \u003cSIX_TEN_PERCENT\u003e this year as per the multibillion dollar deal intel will build custom artificial intelligence ai chips for amazon web services aws expanding a years long partnership between the two companies the work will rely on intel s \u003cONE_TEN\u003e a process an advanced chipmaking technology today s announcement is big intel chief executive officer pat gelsinger said in an interview this is a very discerning customer who has very sophisticated design capabilities aws is among the first major customers intel has announced a definitive deal with in february intel had said microsoft would use its services to manufacture a custom computing chip the us chipmaker is on track to add more than \u003cTHREE_\u003e billion to its market value if gains hold it fell below \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e billion for the first time in three decades this year on monday intel also announced that it is eligible to receive as much as \u003cTHREE_\u003e billion in us government funding to manufacture chips for the military the effort called the secure enclave aims to establish a steady supply of cutting edge chips for defense and intelligence purposes intel also said that it will halt fab projects in poland and germany for about two years raising doubts about the nearly \u003cONE_TEN\u003e billion euros \u003cONE_TEN\u003e billion in subsidies from germany for its two plants in the country the chipmaker is also looking to speed up efforts to execute the \u003cONE_TEN\u003e billion in cost savings and focus its products better on ai computing","timestamp":"2024-09-17T22:53:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-18T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
