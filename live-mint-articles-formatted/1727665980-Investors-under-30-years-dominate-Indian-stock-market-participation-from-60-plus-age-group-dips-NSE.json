It highlighted that between March 2018 and August 2024, there has been a remarkable increase in the share of investors under 30 years.In March 2018, this age group made up only 22.9 per cent of the total investor base. However, by August 2024, their share had grown significantly to 40 per cent, reflecting a rapid rise in the participation of young investors in the stock market.While the younger age group investors have seen a considerable growth, the data revealed that the other age groups have either remained stable or experienced a decline in their market share.As per NSE, the investors aged between 30-39 and 40-49, for instance, have seen their representation in the market remain relatively steady during this period, without major changes in their respective shares. In contrast, older age groups have shown a clear decline in their involvement in the stock market.The data revealed investors aged 50-59 years and those aged 60 years and above have consistently reduced their presence. Particularly, the share of investors of above the 60 age group fell from 12.7 per cent in March 2018 to just 7.2 per cent by August 2024.\"Older age groups (50-59 years and 60 years) have seen a consistent decrease in their respective shares\" NSE added.This shift in the age distribution of stock market participants has also impacted the overall age profile of the registered investor base.According to NSE data, the median age of investors, which was 38 years in March 2018, dropped to 32 years by March 2024. Similarly, the mean age of investors also decreased, falling from 41.2 years in March 2018 to 35.8 years by August 2024.This trend suggests that stock market investing is becoming increasingly popular among younger individuals, while older generations are gradually reducing their participation.","cleaned_content":"indian stock market is now dominated by young investors aged below \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e years highlights the official data by the national stock exchange nse as per the data the number of young investors has surged rapidly in the indian stock market it highlighted that between march \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e and august \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e there has been a remarkable increase in the share of investors under \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e years in march \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e this age group made up only \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of the total investor base however by august \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e their share had grown significantly to \u003cFOUR_TEN_PERCENT\u003e reflecting a rapid rise in the participation of young investors in the stock market while the younger age group investors have seen a considerable growth the data revealed that the other age groups have either remained stable or experienced a decline in their market share as per nse the investors aged between \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e and \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e for instance have seen their representation in the market remain relatively steady during this period without major changes in their respective shares in contrast older age groups have shown a clear decline in their involvement in the stock market the data revealed investors aged \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e years and those aged \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e years and above have consistently reduced their presence particularly the share of investors of above the \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e age group fell from \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in march \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e to just \u003cSEVEN_PERCENT\u003e by august \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e older age groups \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e years and \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e years have seen a consistent decrease in their respective shares nse added this shift in the age distribution of stock market participants has also impacted the overall age profile of the registered investor base according to nse data the median age of investors which was \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e years in march \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e dropped to \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e years by march \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e similarly the mean age of investors also decreased falling from \u003cFOUR_TEN\u003e years in march \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e to \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e years by august \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e this trend suggests that stock market investing is becoming increasingly popular among younger individuals while older generations are gradually reducing their participation","timestamp":"2024-09-30T08:43:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-30T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
