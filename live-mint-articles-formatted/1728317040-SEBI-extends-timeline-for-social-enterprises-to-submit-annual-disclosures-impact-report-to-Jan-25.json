Social enterprises must make annual disclosures and submit 'annual impact report' to the Social Stock Exchange (SSE) by October 31, 2024.\"The outer timeline for annual disclosures under Regulation 91C(1) and annual impact report under Regulation 91E(1) of LODR (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations by Social Enterprises on Social Stock Exchange, for FY 2023-24 has been extended up to January 31, 2025,\" Sebi said in a circular.The annual report involves details of general, governance and finance aspects and annual impact report to SSE captures the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the social impact generated by the social enterprise.In case a Not-for-Profit Organisation is only registered without listing any security, such a report is required to cover the NPO's significant activities, interventions, and programmes, among others.In September 2023, Sebi asked social enterprises raising funds using SSE to disclose the annual impact report within 90 days from the end of the financial year. SSE is a novel concept in India and it is a separate segment of the existing stock exchange, which helps social enterprises to garner funds from the public through the stock exchange mechanism.Social enterprises eligible to participate in the SSE are entities -- NPOs and for-profit social enterprises -- having social intent and impact as their primary goal. Also, such an intent should be demonstrated through its focus on eligible social objectives for the underserved or less privileged populations or regions.The social enterprises will have to engage in a social activity out of 16 broad activities listed by the regulator. The eligible activities include eradicating hunger, poverty, malnutrition and inequality; promoting healthcare; supporting education, employability and livelihoods; gender equality empowerment of women and LGBTQIA communities; and supporting social enterprise incubators.","cleaned_content":"markets regulator sebi on monday extended the timeline to january \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e for social enterprises that have registered or mobilised funds through the social stock exchange to submit annual disclosures and an annual impact report for the financial year \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e social enterprises must make annual disclosures and submit annual impact report to the social stock exchange sse by october \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e the outer timeline for annual disclosures under regulation \u003cNINE_TEN\u003e c \u003cONE_\u003e and annual impact report under regulation \u003cNINE_TEN\u003e e \u003cONE_\u003e of lodr listing obligations and disclosure requirements regulations by social enterprises on social stock exchange for fy \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e has been extended up to january \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e sebi said in a circular the annual report involves details of general governance and finance aspects and annual impact report to sse captures the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the social impact generated by the social enterprise in case a not for profit organisation is only registered without listing any security such a report is required to cover the npos significant activities interventions and programmes among others in september \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e sebi asked social enterprises raising funds using sse to disclose the annual impact report within \u003cNINE_TEN\u003e days from the end of the financial year sse is a novel concept in india and it is a separate segment of the existing stock exchange which helps social enterprises to garner funds from the public through the stock exchange mechanism social enterprises eligible to participate in the sse are entities npos and for profit social enterprises having social intent and impact as their primary goal also such an intent should be demonstrated through its focus on eligible social objectives for the underserved or less privileged populations or regions the social enterprises will have to engage in a social activity out of \u003cONE_TEN\u003e broad activities listed by the regulator the eligible activities include eradicating hunger poverty malnutrition and inequality promoting healthcare supporting education employability and livelihoods gender equality empowerment of women and lgbtqia communities and supporting social enterprise incubators","timestamp":"2024-10-07T21:34:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-08T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
