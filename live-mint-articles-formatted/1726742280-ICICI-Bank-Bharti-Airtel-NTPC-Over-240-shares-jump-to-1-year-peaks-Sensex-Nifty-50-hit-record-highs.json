The Nifty 50 rose to its fresh high of 25,611.95 but settled 38 points, or 0.15 per cent, higher at 25,415.80.On the other hand, the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices dropped 0.53 per cent and 1.06 per cent, respectively, as investors booked profits amid concerns over rich valuations.Due to the fall in the mid and small-cap segment and small gains in the Sensex, the overall market capitalisation of the firms listed on the BSE dropped to nearly  ₹465.7 lakh crore from  ₹467.7 lakh crore in the previous session, making investors poorer by about  ₹2 lakh crore on Thursday.HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, NTPC, Reliance Industries, and Bharti Airtel were the top contributors to the Sensex's gains. However, losses in heavyweight stocks like Larsen \u0026 Toubro, TCS, and HCL Tech limited the overall rise of the benchmark index.\"The benchmark indices concluded with a minor gain after hitting record highs after the US Fed's more than expected interest rate cut of 50 bps and hinted for further reduction. The substantial rate cut sparked concerns over a global slowdown, resulting in profit booking in mid and small-cap trading at a premium valuation. Meanwhile, domestic heavyweight sectors like banking and FMCG saw buying interest, driven by foreign inflows and the RBI's monetary easing expected in October,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.On the technical front, Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, believes the market's larger texture is still positive, but a fresh uptrend rally is possible only after the dismissal of 25,500/83,500.\"Above 25,500/83,500, the market benchmarks could retest the level of 25,600/83,770. Further upside may also continue, lifting the indices to 25,675/84,000. On the other hand, below 25,500/83,500, they could slip to 25,300-25,285/82,900-82,700,\" said Chouhan.Read all market-related news here","cleaned_content":"stocks at record high as many as \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e stocks including icici bank bharti airtel ntpc and britannia industries hit their fresh \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e week highs in intraday trade on bse on thursday september \u003cONE_TEN\u003e amid positive global cues after the us fed cut interest rates by \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e bps and signalled more rate cuts were coming shares of cholamandalam investment and finance company ltimindtree max healthcare institute info edge naukri shriram finance and united spirits were also among those that rose to their one year peaks markets in europe and asia recorded healthy gains as investors cheered the start of the us rate cut cycle for emerging markets like india fed rate cuts trigger an inflow of foreign capital which bodes well for the market key equity indices the sensex and the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e hit their fresh all time highs but closed with mild gains on profit booking the sensex jumped to its record high of \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e before ending at \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e with a gain of \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e rose to its fresh high of \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e but settled \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e points or \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e higher at \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e on the other hand the bse midcap and smallcap indices dropped \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e and \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e respectively as investors booked profits amid concerns over rich valuations due to the fall in the mid and small cap segment and small gains in the sensex the overall market capitalisation of the firms listed on the bse dropped to nearly \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED\u003e lakh crore from \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED\u003e lakh crore in the previous session making investors poorer by about \u003cTWO_\u003e lakh crore on thursday hdfc bank kotak mahindra bank ntpc reliance industries and bharti airtel were the top contributors to the sensexs gains however losses in heavyweight stocks like larsen toubro tcs and hcl tech limited the overall rise of the benchmark index the benchmark indices concluded with a minor gain after hitting record highs after the us feds more than expected interest rate cut of \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e bps and hinted for further reduction the substantial rate cut sparked concerns over a global slowdown resulting in profit booking in mid and small cap trading at a premium valuation meanwhile domestic heavyweight sectors like banking and fmcg saw buying interest driven by foreign inflows and the rbis monetary easing expected in october said vinod nair head of research geojit financial services on the technical front shrikant chouhan the head of equity research at kotak securities believes the markets larger texture is still positive but a fresh uptrend rally is possible only after the dismissal of \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e above \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e the market benchmarks could retest the level of \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e further upside may also continue lifting the indices to \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e on the other hand below \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e they could slip to \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e said chouhan read all market related news here","timestamp":"2024-09-19T16:08:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-20T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
