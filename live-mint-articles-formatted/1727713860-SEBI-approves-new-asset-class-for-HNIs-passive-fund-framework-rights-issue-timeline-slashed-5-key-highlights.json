The market watchdog surprised investors by refraining from announcing measures to limit a surge in derivatives trading, as was widely expected by D-Street experts and traders.SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch had described the surge in derivative trading as a ‘macro issue’ that diverts capital from productive use in the economy. Her warnings — and tax hikes coming into effect next month — have helped lower the volume of contracts traded from a record $6 trillion in February.Also Read: SEBI okays new product bridging MF, PMS1.New asset class for HNIs with higher risk appetiteSEBI stated that asset management companies can now offer riskier strategies, like long-short equity, to high-risk investors with a minimum investment of  ₹10 lakh. Positioned between tightly regulated MFs and lighter-touch portfolio services, this class will give high net worth (HNI) investors exposure to equity derivatives.This is a new investment product under the existing mutual fund framework to bridge the gap between mutual funds and Portfolio Management Services (PMS) regarding flexibility in portfolio construction.“Offerings under the new product will be referred to as ‘Investment Strategies’, to maintain clear distinction from the schemes offered under the traditional MFs. The minimum investment limit for the new product will be  ₹10 lakh per investor across all investment strategies of the new product in a particular AMC. The new product is intended to add depth and variety to the country's investment landscape through a new asset class,” said SEBI.Also Read: SEBI board meeting today amid growing pressure on Chairperson Madhabi Buch over conflict of interestThe safeguards for the new product will include no leverage, no investment in unlisted and unrated instruments beyond those already permitted for mutual funds and derivatives exposure limited to 25 per cent of assets under management (AUM) for purposes other than hedging and rebalancing.2.Introduction of MF Lite framework for passive fundsSEBI introduced a relaxed framework with light-touch regulations, ‘MF Lite,’ for entities desirous of launching only passive mutual fund schemes. The MF Lite framework or light-touch regulations include relaxed requirements relating to eligibility criteria for sponsors, including net worth, track record, profitability, the responsibility of trustees, approval process, and disclosures.The framework intends to promote ease of entry, encourage new players, reduce compliance requirements, increase penetration, enhance market liquidity, facilitate investment diversification and foster innovation.Also Read: SEBI cuts down timeline for debt securities from T+6 to T+3Various provisions of the existing regulatory framework may not be relevant for passively managed schemes. A relaxed framework with light-touch regulations has been approved as MF Lite Regulations for passive MF schemes.SEBI said that existing AMCs with active and passive schemes will have the option to hive off respective passive schemes, if they so desire, to a different group entity, resulting in the management of active and passive schemes by separate AMCs under a common sponsor.If they choose to continue the passively managed schemes within the existing AMCs under the existing MF Regulations, the relaxed disclosures and other regulatory requirements for the passive schemes based on indices covered under the MF Lite framework will also apply to them.Also Read: Risk managers in demand as Sebi wants another 1,000 firms to tighten control3.Rights issue timeline slashed to 23 daysSEBI has approved norms to enable faster rights issues through the preferential allotment route. This new route can be completed in 23 days from the issuer's board meeting approving the rights issue, versus the present timeline of 317 days, and faster than the 40 working days needed to complete the preferential allotment.SEBI approved discontinuing the current requirement of filing a draft letter of rights offer with Sebi of its observation. Instead, it will be filed with stock exchanges for its in-principle approval, as the entity is already listed. Stock exchanges would confirm that the issuer complies with LODR disclosure requirements.SEBI called for “rationalization of the content of Letter of Offer to contain only the relevant incremental information regarding rights issue viz. object of issue, price, record date, entitlement ratio, etc.” SEBI also dispensed with the mandatory requirement that an issuer appoint a merchant banker and made it optional subject to completion of rights issue within 23 working days.Also Read: SEBI may adopt all Padmanabhan committee measures to curb retail F\u0026O frenzy\"With reduced timelines, corporates can have faster access to funds through rights issues. Revised rights issue timelines would make it a preferred option for fundraising as it allows all existing shareholders to be a part of the company's growth story,” said Makarand M Joshi, Founder MMJC and Associates, a corporate compliance firm.4.Expansion of ‘connected person’ under insider trading normsSEBI expanded the definition of “connected person” and “immediate relative” under insider trading regulations to facilitate effective investigation and enforcement against insider trading. The spouse, child, parent, and sibling of the person have been added under the definition of ‘relative’.“SEBI's decision to expand the scope of connected persons would increase the scope of the prohibition of insider trading regulations,” said Makarand M Joshi.“It would bring within its ambit many more persons (viz, a person sharing a household or residence with a ‘connected person, a firm or its partner or its employee in which a ‘connected person’ is also a partner, etc). who are indirectly associated with the securities market through intermediaries, fiduciaries or distant relatives of persons working in listed companies,” he added.Also Read: SEBI's UDiFF cuts reporting formats from 200 to 23, members to save  ₹200 crore5.Eligibility norms for IAs, RAs relaxed; UPI options to tradeQualified stock brokers will mandatorily offer investors the option to trade in the secondary market - cash segment using a UPI block mechanism (ASBA-like for secondary markets) or a three-in-one trading facility in addition to the current trading mode.
