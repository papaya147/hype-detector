With the Nifty 50 index dipping below 25,300, investors are urged to adopt a cautious, stock-specific approach to navigate these turbulent waters.","content":"Breakout stocks to buy or sell: The domestic benchmark indices of the Indian stock market, Sensex and Nifty 50, crashed on Thursday, marking the worst intraday drop in two months. This was due to waning investor confidence following the rising tensions between Iran and Israel, which shifted interest from riskier assets such as stocks. The Nifty 50 index crashed 546 points and closed at the 25,250 mark; the BSE Sensex tanked 1,769 points and finished at 82,497, whereas the Nifty Bank index ended 1,077 points lower at 51,845. The market capitalisation of all listed companies tumbled by more than  ₹10 lakh crore.Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, believes that Indian stock market investors must trade cautiously as the Nifty 50 index has slipped below the 25,300 mark. The Choice Broking expert said that the 50-stock index may come close to the 25,000 mark as the Indian stock market trend is still looking bearish on the technical chart pattern. He advised a stock-specific approach with a focus on breakout stocks.\"The Indian stock market trend has weakened after the Nifty 50 index slipped below the 25,300 mark. The near-term support for the 50-stock index is currently placed at the 25,000 mark, and the frontline index may showcase some pullback if the index slips in the vicinity of the 25,000 mark. Those who believe in a stock-specific approach may look at breakout stocks for intraday trading,\" said Sumeet Bagadia.Regarding breakout stocks to buy today, Sumeet Bagadia recommended buying these five shares: Malu Paper Mills, Anup Engineering, Kapston Services, BF Utilities, and Amber Enterprises.1] Malu Paper Mills: Buy at  ₹53.50, target  ₹57, stop loss  ₹51.60;2] Anup Engineering: Buy at  ₹2607.35, target  ₹2777, stop loss  ₹2515;3] Kapston Services: Buy at  ₹245, target  ₹263, stop loss  ₹236;4] BF Utilities: Buy at  ₹989, target  ₹1050, stop loss  ₹960; and5] Amber Enterprises: Buy at  ₹5163.85, target  ₹5500, stop loss  ₹4980.","cleaned_content":"breakout stocks to buy or sell the domestic benchmark indices of the indian stock market sensex and nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e crashed on thursday marking the worst intraday drop in two months this was due to waning investor confidence following the rising tensions between iran and israel which shifted interest from riskier assets such as stocks the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e index crashed \u003cFIVE_HUNDRED\u003e points and closed at the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark the bse sensex tanked \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e points and finished at \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e whereas the nifty bank index ended \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e points lower at \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e the market capitalisation of all listed companies tumbled by more than \u003cONE_TEN\u003e lakh crore sumeet bagadia executive director at choice broking believes that indian stock market investors must trade cautiously as the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e index has slipped below the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark the choice broking expert said that the \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e stock index may come close to the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark as the indian stock market trend is still looking bearish on the technical chart pattern he advised a stock specific approach with a focus on breakout stocks the indian stock market trend has weakened after the nifty \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e index slipped below the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark the near term support for the \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e stock index is currently placed at the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark and the frontline index may showcase some pullback if the index slips in the vicinity of the \u003cTWO_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e mark those who believe in a stock specific approach may look at breakout stocks for intraday trading said sumeet bagadia regarding breakout stocks to buy today sumeet bagadia recommended buying these five shares malu paper mills anup engineering kapston services bf utilities and amber enterprises 1 malu paper mills buy at \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e target \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e stop loss \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e \u003cTWO_\u003e anup engineering buy at \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e target \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e stop loss \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cTHREE_\u003e kapston services buy at \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e target \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e stop loss \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e \u003cFOUR_\u003e bf utilities buy at \u003cNINE_HUNDRED\u003e target \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e stop loss \u003cNINE_HUNDRED\u003e and5 amber enterprises buy at \u003cFIVE_THOUSAND\u003e target \u003cFIVE_THOUSAND\u003e stop loss \u003cFOUR_THOUSAND\u003e","timestamp":"2024-10-04T08:00:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-04T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
