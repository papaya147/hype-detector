ByteDance has ordered over 100,000 Ascend 910B chips but received fewer than 30,000. The new model will be less powerful than its existing Doubao AI model.","content":"TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance plans to develop an AI model trained primarily with chips from compatriot Huawei Technologies, said three people familiar with the matter, as U.S. curbs turn the social media giant homeward in search of chips.

AI has become central to the technology industry with firms in sectors as varied as gaming and e-commerce differentiating offerings through the integration of custom AI models - programs that employ pattern recognition to make decisions. ByteDance's next step in the AI race is to use Huawei's Ascend 910B chip to train a large-language AI model, said the people, declining to be identified as the plan is confidential. A fourth person also said ByteDance is planning a new AI model but could not say whether it will use Huawei chips.","cleaned_content":"tiktoks chinese parent bytedance plans to develop an ai model trained primarily with chips from compatriot huawei technologies said three people familiar with the matter as u s curbs turn the social media giant homeward in search of chips bytedance has diversified to domestic suppliers of chips used in artificial intelligence and accelerated development of its own since the u s in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e started restricting exports of advanced ai chips such as from market leader nvidia ai has become central to the technology industry with firms in sectors as varied as gaming and e commerce differentiating offerings through the integration of custom ai models programs that employ pattern recognition to make decisions bytedances next step in the ai race is to use huaweis ascend \u003cNINE_HUNDRED\u003e b chip to train a large language ai model said the people declining to be identified as the plan is confidential a fourth person also said bytedance is planning a new ai model but could not say whether it will use huawei chips","timestamp":"2024-09-30T11:40:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-30T11:40:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
