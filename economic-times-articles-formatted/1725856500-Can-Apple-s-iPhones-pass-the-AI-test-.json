The device's biggest selling point was a new software feature called Siri, which helped cause a jump in iPhone sales. On Monday, Apple is planning to run that play again. For the first time in more than a decade, the tech giant will unveil a suite of iPhones whose signature feature won't be an improved camera or an updated design, but new software capabilities. The system, called Apple Intelligence, will sort messages, offer writing suggestions and create a more capable Siri powered by generative artificial intelligence. The new iPhones represent a big moment for generative AI, which can answer questions, create images and write software code. As a latecomer to the AI party, Apple is in a position to take the technology mainstream -- or sow fresh doubt about its viability if it doesn't live up to expectations. Early enthusiasm for AI has been tempered by questions about its utility. This spring, Microsoft postponed features in an AI computer because of security vulnerabilities around the technology's recording of every second of activity. Humane, a startup that raised $240 million for a device called the Ai Pin, was panned by tech reviewers because its system was slow to fulfill requests and sometimes fielded them inaccurately.","cleaned_content":"shortly before steve jobs death in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e apple filled a cramped auditorium in cupertino california for the unveiling of its fifth iphone the devices biggest selling point was a new software feature called siri which helped cause a jump in iphone sales on monday apple is planning to run that play again for the first time in more than a decade the tech giant will unveil a suite of iphones whose signature feature wont be an improved camera or an updated design but new software capabilities the system called apple intelligence will sort messages offer writing suggestions and create a more capable siri powered by generative artificial intelligence the new iphones represent a big moment for generative ai which can answer questions create images and write software code as a latecomer to the ai party apple is in a position to take the technology mainstream or sow fresh doubt about its viability if it doesnt live up to expectations early enthusiasm for ai has been tempered by questions about its utility this spring microsoft postponed features in an ai computer because of security vulnerabilities around the technologys recording of every second of activity humane a startup that raised \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e million for a device called the ai pin was panned by tech reviewers because its system was slow to fulfill requests and sometimes fielded them inaccurately","timestamp":"2024-09-09T10:05:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-09T10:05:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
