With ambitious plans to expand Tesla's robotaxi fleet, Musk aims to keep the company at the forefront of the AI-driven mobility revolution.","content":"Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled long-anticipated prototypes of the Cybercab, the company’s new robotaxi, at an event in Burbank, California. Musk announced that production might start as early as 2026, with the vehicle expected to cost less than $30,000. To mark the occasion, Musk arrived on stage in one of the prototypes, showcasing the vehicle's futuristic design.Tesla’s latest event, \"We, Robot,\" held at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, showcased the long-awaited robotaxi, a critical component of the company's future growth strategy. CEO Elon Musk used the opportunity to update investors on the company's progress in artificial intelligence (AI) projects, which he believes will drive Tesla’s long-term success. \"We constructed a futuristic world,\" Musk shared on social media platform X, responding to images from an attendee.Tesla Cybercab Robotaxi: PriceElon Musk announced that the upcoming self-driving Cybercab will be available for under $30,000, with production expected to begin in 2026. This price point is significantly lower than the current starting price of the Model 3 sedan, which exceeds $42,000, especially after Tesla discontinued the base rear-wheel-drive version following the recent tariffs on Chinese-sourced components.While the proposed price for the Cybercab seems appealing, it is essential to note that Tesla has a history of overpromising and underdelivering on vehicle pricing. For example, the Cybertruck was initially projected to cost under $50,000 but now starts at around $80,000. This track record raises questions about whether the Cybercab will ultimately meet its anticipated price, as potential buyers remain cautious based on past experiences with the company.In addition to the Cybercab, Tesla revealed a Robovan concept, a larger autonomous vehicle capable of transporting up to 20 people at a time. Both the Cybercab and Robovan signal Tesla's efforts to expand into the autonomous transportation market, with the Cybercab positioned as a more affordable option for consumers looking to use or rent out self-driving vehicles through the Tesla network.","cleaned_content":"tesla ceo elon musk unveiled long anticipated prototypes of the cybercab the company s new robotaxi at an event in burbank california musk announced that production might start as early as \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e with the vehicle expected to cost less than \u003cTHREE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e to mark the occasion musk arrived on stage in one of the prototypes showcasing the vehicles futuristic design tesla s latest event we robot held at warner bros studios in burbank california showcased the long awaited robotaxi a critical component of the companys future growth strategy ceo elon musk used the opportunity to update investors on the companys progress in artificial intelligence ai projects which he believes will drive tesla s long term success we constructed a futuristic world musk shared on social media platform x responding to images from an attendee tesla cybercab robotaxi priceelon musk announced that the upcoming self driving cybercab will be available for under \u003cTHREE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e with production expected to begin in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e this price point is significantly lower than the current starting price of the model \u003cTHREE_\u003e sedan which exceeds \u003cFOUR_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e especially after tesla discontinued the base rear wheel drive version following the recent tariffs on chinese sourced components while the proposed price for the cybercab seems appealing it is essential to note that tesla has a history of overpromising and underdelivering on vehicle pricing for example the cybertruck was initially projected to cost under \u003cFIVE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e but now starts at around \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e this track record raises questions about whether the cybercab will ultimately meet its anticipated price as potential buyers remain cautious based on past experiences with the company in addition to the cybercab tesla revealed a robovan concept a larger autonomous vehicle capable of transporting up to \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e people at a time both the cybercab and robovan signal teslas efforts to expand into the autonomous transportation market with the cybercab positioned as a more affordable option for consumers looking to use or rent out self driving vehicles through the tesla network","timestamp":"2024-10-11T17:06:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-14T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
