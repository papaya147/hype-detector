The subdued outlook is attributed to continuing global macroeconomic headwinds lead to modest increase in technology spends in the key markets of the US and Europe.The FY25 growth outlook follows a 12% compound annual growth over the decade through fiscal 2024 and ~6% year-on-year (YoY) growth expected for fiscal 2024, Crisil said.The overall IT industry, which employs around 50 lakh direct employees, has been going through a slowdown over the past 4-5 quarters.“Operating margin, however, should sustain at 22-23% due to prudent management of employee costs (constitutes ~85% of total expenses and includes sub-contracting costs), through cautious hiring and with lower attrition reducing replacement cost,” Crisil said in a report.For FY24, so far top three IT majors have reported subdued revenue but stable margins. TCS led with revenue growth of 6.8% to $29 billion, followed by Infosys with $18.6 billion growing at 4.7% while Wipro declined 0.8% with revenues at $10.8 billion in constant currency terms.","cleaned_content":"the \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e billion information technology it services sector is likely to see a second consecutive year of sluggish growth in fiscal year ending march \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e with revenue seen rising \u003cFIVE_\u003e \u003cSEVEN_PERCENT\u003e according to crisil ratings report the subdued outlook is attributed to continuing global macroeconomic headwinds lead to modest increase in technology spends in the key markets of the us and europe the fy25 growth outlook follows a \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e compound annual growth over the decade through fiscal \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e and \u003cSIX_PERCENT\u003e year on year yoy growth expected for fiscal \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e crisil said the overall it industry which employs around \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e lakh direct employees has been going through a slowdown over the past \u003cFOUR_\u003e \u003cFIVE_\u003e quarters operating margin however should sustain at \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e due to prudent management of employee costs constitutes \u003cEIGHT_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of total expenses and includes sub contracting costs through cautious hiring and with lower attrition reducing replacement cost crisil said in a report for fy24 so far top three it majors have reported subdued revenue but stable margins tcs led with revenue growth of \u003cSIX_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e billion followed by infosys with \u003cONE_TEN\u003e billion growing at \u003cFOUR_PERCENT\u003e while wipro declined \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e with revenues at \u003cONE_TEN\u003e billion in constant currency terms","timestamp":"2024-04-24T16:46:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-04-25T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
