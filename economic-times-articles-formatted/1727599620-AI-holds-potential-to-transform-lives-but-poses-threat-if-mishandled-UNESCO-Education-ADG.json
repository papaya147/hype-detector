In an interview with PTI from Paris, Giannini, who is also the former Minister of Education in Italy, said each technological revolution has had broad social and educational implications, radically changing the way we live and how we learn. She flagged that the digital divide in countries is still very much deep and the new technology, if not driven and supported by the appropriate investments, will widen this divide. \"Over the course of my career, I have witnessed at least four digital revolutions - from the advent of personal computers to the expansion of the internet, to the emergence of mobile devices and social media and to the rapid and unexpected arrival of generative artificial intelligence (AI) like ChatGPT,\" she said. Giannini said that each technological revolution has had broad social and educational implications, radically changing the way we live and how we learn.
