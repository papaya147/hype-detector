He emphasized that hybrid cars do not align with these objectives, as they run on polluting fossil fuel and cannot be compared to pure electric vehicles (EVs). Chandra highlighted that hybrid cars help improve fuel efficiency and meet emission-related regulations, but they should not receive the same support as EVs. He stressed the need to support zero-emission technologies to counter air pollution and achieve net zero goals.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-01-21T10:47:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-01-22T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
