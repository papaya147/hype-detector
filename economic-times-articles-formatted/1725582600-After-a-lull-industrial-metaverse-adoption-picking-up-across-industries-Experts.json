Today, because the industrial metaverse is in some way a combination of computer vision, extended reality and digital twins, fortunately, all of these are maturing to a really good extent.”He further said, “Therefore, we are seeing a lot more positive application of metaverse (in industries). In the recent past, we have seen a few pilots being done by different companies. Today we are seeing a scaled deployment of metaverse.”Chakravarti said the convergence and maturing of technologies such as AI, IOT, cloud and extended reality have given the industry the right price points. Since all of these are very data heavy and require analytics in real time, the industrial metaverse got a boost from supporting technologies, he said, adding, “We will see a fairly significant acceleration in the industrial metaverse in the next few years.”","cleaned_content":"the adoption of industrial metaverse has accelerated with the maturing of technologies such as artificial intelligence ai generative ai genai cloud internet of things iot extended reality \u003cFIVE_\u003e g and edge computing after a lull during the covid \u003cONE_TEN\u003e pandemic said industry executives and experts they said the industrial metaverse which refers to the digital world that mirrors the physical world leveraging the technologies has found the right price points to generate good returns on investment roi with supporting technologies scaling up industrial metaverse has gone through its waves said sreenivasa chakravarti vice president iot and digital engineering tcs as always with any new technology there is a hype when it peaks and then it slows down and then again it picks up today because the industrial metaverse is in some way a combination of computer vision extended reality and digital twins fortunately all of these are maturing to a really good extent he further said therefore we are seeing a lot more positive application of metaverse in industries in the recent past we have seen a few pilots being done by different companies today we are seeing a scaled deployment of metaverse chakravarti said the convergence and maturing of technologies such as ai iot cloud and extended reality have given the industry the right price points since all of these are very data heavy and require analytics in real time the industrial metaverse got a boost from supporting technologies he said adding we will see a fairly significant acceleration in the industrial metaverse in the next few years","timestamp":"2024-09-06T06:00:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-06T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
