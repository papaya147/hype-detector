There is a shortfall in data around conversations between relationship managers and investors. The lack of access to such data means AI powered investment advisors will be difficult to build right away, they said.“In the US, a lot of work is happening around learning non-linear regression models using AI and the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) specific to the finance domain, where unstructured financial reports and documents are being fed into AI. In India, the work on LLMs is primarily around the applications of generic LLMs, like conversational AI, as of now,” said Satya Gautam Vadlamudi, cofounder of Elystar Investment Management, a Mumbai-based Sebi registered advisory firm.
