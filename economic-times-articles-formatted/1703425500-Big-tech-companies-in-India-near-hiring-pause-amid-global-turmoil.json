It will be a signal for smaller companies to stay cautious, he said.","cleaned_content":"the big tech pack of faamng companies in india which is generally seen as shaping the talent trend for the rest of the tech cohort in the country are in a near hiring pause amid the macroeconomic headwinds and global layoffs these companies facebook meta platforms amazon apple microsoft netflix and google alphabet registered a \u003cNINE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e drop in active job postings in india in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e compared with the previous year according to data put together for et by specialist staffing firm xpheno the cohort remains at its lowest action point with current active hiring numbers down by more than \u003cNINE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e compared with its typical active hiring volume in india this comes at a time when the tech industry is grappling with the global economic slowdown as reflected in the uncertainty around pipeline conversion project ramp downs sluggish revenue growth and a cautious approach by clients the low to no hiring action maintained by the cohort over the year will continue to impact tech talent movements especially in the experienced lateral layers said prasadh ms head of workforce research at xpheno it will be a signal for smaller companies to stay cautious he said","timestamp":"2023-12-24T19:15:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2023-12-25T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
