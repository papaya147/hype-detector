These cities may have been overlooked before, but with better infrastructure like reliable power supply and affordable high-speed internet, they are becoming talent hubs.","content":"Reverse migration of tech employees to their hometowns during the pandemic has shifted the battle for talent to tier-2 and smaller cities, which hold the default advantage of lower operational costs and low attrition rates.Two recent reports – the Economic Survey and Infosys ESG – suggest that tech firms and global capability centres (GCCs) of multinationals are increasingly expanding their operations beyond metros, thanks to a newer base of talent available after their relocation during Covid.What is driving them to smaller cities is high availability of talent that migrated during pandemic and didn’t return to their work locations post pandemic plus cost benefit across operations, said Munira Loliwala, vice president for strategy and growth at TeamLease Digital.“Hiring is 60-70% more cost effective, infrastructure more viable and scalable. These locations offer cost arbitrage, standardisation, lower attrition rates, better government policies and subsidies,” she said.As per TeamLease data, emerging tech hubs such as Chandigarh, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Indore, Bhubaneswar, Vizag, Coimbatore and Kochi have a combined installed tech talent of 490,000-540,000. That is around 10% of the total technology talent pool of about 5.5 million available in the country.","cleaned_content":"reverse migration of tech employees to their hometowns during the pandemic has shifted the battle for talent to tier \u003cTWO_\u003e and smaller cities which hold the default advantage of lower operational costs and low attrition rates two recent reports the economic survey and infosys esg suggest that tech firms and global capability centres gccs of multinationals are increasingly expanding their operations beyond metros thanks to a newer base of talent available after their relocation during covid what is driving them to smaller cities is high availability of talent that migrated during pandemic and didn t return to their work locations post pandemic plus cost benefit across operations said munira loliwala vice president for strategy and growth at teamlease digital hiring is \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e \u003cSEVEN_TEN_PERCENT\u003e more cost effective infrastructure more viable and scalable these locations offer cost arbitrage standardisation lower attrition rates better government policies and subsidies she said as per teamlease data emerging tech hubs such as chandigarh jaipur ahmedabad indore bhubaneswar vizag coimbatore and kochi have a combined installed tech talent of \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED_THOUSAND\u003e \u003cFIVE_HUNDRED_THOUSAND\u003e that is around \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of the total technology talent pool of about \u003cFIVE_\u003e million available in the country","timestamp":"2024-08-06T06:11:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-08-06T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
