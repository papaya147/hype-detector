The analysis looked at Wipro, Infosys, TCS, HCL, LTI Mindtree, L\u0026T Technology Services, Tech Mahindra and Cognizant.“While gross hiring (attrition refills and fresh hiring) has been low and declining for eight quarters, the current rise in active demand denotes a return of hiring for capacity in the ITS cohort,” said Anil Ethanur, co-founder, Xpheno.“With the 4-6% drop, the gross hiring volume for the quarter ending March 2024 could emerge the lowest in more than two fiscal years. But despite the dip in gross hiring, the combined impact of lowered exits, will result in a headcount degrowth that's lesser compared to previous quarter,” he added.
