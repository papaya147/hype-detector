Two days later, the GNSS-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) instrument on the EOS-08 satellite commenced operations on August 18. The raw data is being processed at the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC-ISRO) in Shadnagar, Hyderabad, using algorithms and data processing software developed by the Space Applications Centre (SAC-ISRO), Ahmedabad. \"Multiple levels of data products have been successfully generated,\" Isro said, in a statement.GNSS-Reflectometry represents a new mode of remote sensing. Signals from Global and Regional Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS/RNSS), such as GPS and NavIC, are reflected off various Earth surfaces, including oceans, agricultural lands, and river bodies. These reflected signals are collected by a precision receiver onboard the satellite as it orbits the Earth at an altitude of 475 km. This measurement system operates without dedicated transmitters and is shallow in resource consumptionâ€”requiring minimal size, weight, and power. \"Additionally, it can scale up as a constellation of receivers for faster coverage, making this innovative remote-sensing mode highly useful,\" the space agency said.","cleaned_content":"the indian space research organisation isro on wednesday said it has successfully generated multiple levels of data products from its recently launched earth observation satellite eos \u003cEIGHT_\u003e and that these results demonstrate immense potential for various scientific studies and applications on august \u003cONE_TEN\u003e isro had launched eos \u003cEIGHT_\u003e carrying payloads featuring new technology developments in satellite mainframe systems on board a small satellite launch vehicle sslv from the satish dhawan space centre in sriharikota andhra pradesh two days later the gnss reflectometry gnss r instrument on the eos \u003cEIGHT_\u003e satellite commenced operations on august \u003cONE_TEN\u003e the raw data is being processed at the national remote sensing centre nrsc isro in shadnagar hyderabad using algorithms and data processing software developed by the space applications centre sac isro ahmedabad multiple levels of data products have been successfully generated isro said in a statement gnss reflectometry represents a new mode of remote sensing signals from global and regional navigation satellite systems gnss rnss such as gps and navic are reflected off various earth surfaces including oceans agricultural lands and river bodies these reflected signals are collected by a precision receiver onboard the satellite as it orbits the earth at an altitude of \u003cFOUR_HUNDRED\u003e km this measurement system operates without dedicated transmitters and is shallow in resource consumption requiring minimal size weight and power additionally it can scale up as a constellation of receivers for faster coverage making this innovative remote sensing mode highly useful the space agency said","timestamp":"2024-08-28T20:39:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-08-29T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
