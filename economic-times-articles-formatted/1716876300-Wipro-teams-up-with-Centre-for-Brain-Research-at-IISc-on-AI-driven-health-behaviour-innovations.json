CBR is an autonomous, non-profit research organisation, hosted at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).  A release announcing the collaboration between Wipro and Centre for Brain Research said the partnership will \"focus on harnessing the power of AI, ML and big data analytics to develop new technologies that will provide precision support towards the prevention and management of long-term health disorders\".  Wipro's Research \u0026 Development (R\u0026D) team will design and develop a personal care engine, an AI that will take into account an individual's health history, desired health state, and other behavioural responses to promote healthy ageing, positive lifestyle changes, and psycho-social wellbeing to meaningfully improve an individual's health over time.  \"The personal care engine will focus on reducing and managing the risk of cardiovascular disease and correlated neurodegenerative disorders, by using AI to personalise its interaction with users, optimising for their long-term health and wellbeing,\" the release said.  Wipro will test the engine through a digital app-based trial in collaboration with CBR at IISc.
