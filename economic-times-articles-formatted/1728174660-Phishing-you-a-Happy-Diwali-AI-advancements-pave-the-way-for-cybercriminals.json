Cyberattacks and frauds are up 20-25% as compared to non-festive periods, data suggests. This year, it may be even harder for unsuspecting people to spot a scam, according to experts. AI-enabled technology, including deepfakes, has come of age and will make its presence felt, particularly in social engineering attempts, they said. Social engineering in the context of cybersecurity refers to when cybercriminals aim to psychologically manipulate, influence or deceive victims in order to steal their personal or financial information, or gain control over a computer system. Users may unwittingly end up sharing their login credentials, banking details, one-time passwords (OTPs) or personal data that cybercriminals can exploit. Sharath Bulusu, director, product management, Google, said scammers’ modes of working are getting faster and more innovative. Moreover, Gen AI presents a new threat vector. As the amount of data available in such instances increases, technology’s ability to detect synthetic data and identify anomalous and fraudulent behaviour is also improving every few months and can be the key to addressing user harm over time, said Bulusu, who heads Google Pay in India. “From India, we end up learning a lot of thing that we can apply in other places,” Bulusu said. “In terms of fraud and cybercrime, what happens is because we get more data points, we learn faster, because a lot of AI and ML is based on being able to learn from data points.” He said the entire ecosystem must collaborate to tackle AI-powered fraud, and that entities releasing Gen AI models must invest in guardrails to prevent misuse. “There will always be technical threats, but generally, India is well guarded against them… Where users get slammed is with social engineering,” he added.Festive fraud","cleaned_content":"as indians seek to make the most of the festive season they need to stay vigilant of a dark shadow increasingly associated with this period of celebration and gifting cyberattacks and frauds are up \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e as compared to non festive periods data suggests this year it may be even harder for unsuspecting people to spot a scam according to experts ai enabled technology including deepfakes has come of age and will make its presence felt particularly in social engineering attempts they said social engineering in the context of cybersecurity refers to when cybercriminals aim to psychologically manipulate influence or deceive victims in order to steal their personal or financial information or gain control over a computer system users may unwittingly end up sharing their login credentials banking details one time passwords otps or personal data that cybercriminals can exploit sharath bulusu director product management google said scammers modes of working are getting faster and more innovative moreover gen ai presents a new threat vector as the amount of data available in such instances increases technology s ability to detect synthetic data and identify anomalous and fraudulent behaviour is also improving every few months and can be the key to addressing user harm over time said bulusu who heads google pay in india from india we end up learning a lot of thing that we can apply in other places bulusu said in terms of fraud and cybercrime what happens is because we get more data points we learn faster because a lot of ai and ml is based on being able to learn from data points he said the entire ecosystem must collaborate to tackle ai powered fraud and that entities releasing gen ai models must invest in guardrails to prevent misuse there will always be technical threats but generally india is well guarded against them where users get slammed is with social engineering he added festive fraud","timestamp":"2024-10-06T06:01:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-07T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
