The Tata subsidiary missed market estimates for the July to September quarter net profit after reporting a 1.08% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) decline at Rs 11,909 crore. The drop was largely on the back of margin dilutive projects in the non-American region. Revenues during the July to September period also grew slower at 2.6% at Rs 64,259 crore. America, which accounts for 51.7% of the total revenue, declined 1.8% from the June quarter. \"Overall, Q2FY25 was a modest quarter for TCS, mainly due to client specific issues...We expect growth for TCS as well as the sector to see a material uptick Q4FY25 onwards,\" said a Nuvama (formerly Edelweiss) institutional equities report. K Krithivasan, chief executive at TCS, said, \"As a general trend in the major markets, the demand outlook continues to remain cautious, as seen in the last few quarters.\"   ","cleaned_content":"the latest quarterly results of the largest software services provider tata consultancy services tcs signal a delayed recovery outlook for the leader of the \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e billion it services industry we cut earnings estimates by \u003cONE_\u003e \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e for fy25 \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e considering the q2 miss weak discretionary spending client specific challenges slower decision making and clients cautious behavior amid macro uncertainties weighed on revenue growth said an emkay report on tcs post results the tata subsidiary missed market estimates for the july to september quarter net profit after reporting a \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e quarter on quarter qoq decline at rs \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore the drop was largely on the back of margin dilutive projects in the non american region revenues during the july to september period also grew slower at \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e at rs \u003cSIX_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e crore america which accounts for \u003cFIVE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of the total revenue declined \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e from the june quarter overall q2fy25 was a modest quarter for tcs mainly due to client specific issues we expect growth for tcs as well as the sector to see a material uptick q4fy25 onwards said a nuvama formerly edelweiss institutional equities report k krithivasan chief executive at tcs said as a general trend in the major markets the demand outlook continues to remain cautious as seen in the last few quarters","timestamp":"2024-10-14T17:21:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-15T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
