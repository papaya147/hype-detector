This development includes governments aiming to strengthen national security with customized AI models and infrastructure. Countries' movements are expected to significantly contribute to Nvidia's revenue, projecting around low double-digit billions by January 2025.","content":"Nations building artificial intelligence models in their own languages are turning to Nvidia's chips, adding to already booming demand as generative AI takes center stage for businesses and governments, a senior executive said on Wednesday.  Nvidia's third-quarter forecast for rising sales of its chips that power AI technology such as OpenAI's ChatGPT failed to meet investors' towering expectations. But the company described new customers coming from around the world, including governments that are now seeking their own AI models and the hardware to support them.  Countries adopting their own AI applications and models will contribute about low double-digit billions to Nvidia's revenue in the financial year ending in January 2025, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a call with analysts after Nvidia's earnings report. That's up from an earlier forecast of such sales contributing high single-digit billions to total revenue. Nvidia forecast about $32.5 billion in total revenue in the third quarter ending in October. \"Countries around the world (desire) to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country,\" Kress said, describing AI expertise and infrastructure as \"national imperatives.\" ","cleaned_content":"nations building artificial intelligence models in their own languages are turning to nvidias chips adding to already booming demand as generative ai takes center stage for businesses and governments a senior executive said on wednesday nvidias third quarter forecast for rising sales of its chips that power ai technology such as openais chatgpt failed to meet investors towering expectations but the company described new customers coming from around the world including governments that are now seeking their own ai models and the hardware to support them countries adopting their own ai applications and models will contribute about low double digit billions to nvidias revenue in the financial year ending in january \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e chief financial officer colette kress said on a call with analysts after nvidias earnings report thats up from an earlier forecast of such sales contributing high single digit billions to total revenue nvidia forecast about \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e billion in total revenue in the third quarter ending in october countries around the world desire to have their own generative ai that would be able to incorporate their own language incorporate their own culture incorporate their own data in that country kress said describing ai expertise and infrastructure as national imperatives","timestamp":"2024-08-29T09:01:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-08-29T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
