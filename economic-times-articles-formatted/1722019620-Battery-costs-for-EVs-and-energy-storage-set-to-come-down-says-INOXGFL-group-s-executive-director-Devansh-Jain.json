Jain stated that battery chemicals made up about 35% of EV battery costs, and reducing import duties would lower overall EV costs. The initiative, along with the PLI scheme, aimed to encourage investments in EV battery manufacturing. Jain also noted that the high cost of battery storage hindered large-scale adoption, which required significant cost reductions for broader use.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-07-27T00:17:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-07-29T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
