It is now evolving into hundreds of autonomous companies that collectively contribute to the production of a single chip. However, this has led to a ‘too big to fail’ syndrome, where a few dominant players control each segment of the industry.","content":"As the second phase of the semiconductor policy, Semicon 2.0, approaches, the first phase has already proven successful in raising awareness about market potential, workforce scalability and deep engineering talent, leading to significant investments and policy reforms in semiconductor manufacturing. Now, the focus should shift to execution, which is crucial for success. This phase demands a robust strategy, effective execution and a passionate commitment to thrive.In the next couple of years, India should aim to establish at least two semiconductor companies among the global top 10 and attain self-sufficiency in critical infrastructure across power, communications, space and defence sectors. To realise these ambitious goals, India must carefully select a development model for its semiconductor industry.","cleaned_content":"as the second phase of the semiconductor policy semicon \u003cTWO_\u003e approaches the first phase has already proven successful in raising awareness about market potential workforce scalability and deep engineering talent leading to significant investments and policy reforms in semiconductor manufacturing now the focus should shift to execution which is crucial for success this phase demands a robust strategy effective execution and a passionate commitment to thrive in the next couple of years india should aim to establish at least two semiconductor companies among the global top \u003cONE_TEN\u003e and attain self sufficiency in critical infrastructure across power communications space and defence sectors to realise these ambitious goals india must carefully select a development model for its semiconductor industry","timestamp":"2024-10-06T06:11:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-07T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
