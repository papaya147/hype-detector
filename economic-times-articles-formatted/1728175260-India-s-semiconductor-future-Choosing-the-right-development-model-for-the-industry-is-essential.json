It is now evolving into hundreds of autonomous companies that collectively contribute to the production of a single chip. However, this has led to a ‘too big to fail’ syndrome, where a few dominant players control each segment of the industry.","content":"As the second phase of the semiconductor policy, Semicon 2.0, approaches, the first phase has already proven successful in raising awareness about market potential, workforce scalability and deep engineering talent, leading to significant investments and policy reforms in semiconductor manufacturing. Now, the focus should shift to execution, which is crucial for success. This phase demands a robust strategy, effective execution and a passionate commitment to thrive.In the next couple of years, India should aim to establish at least two semiconductor companies among the global top 10 and attain self-sufficiency in critical infrastructure across power, communications, space and defence sectors. To realise these ambitious goals, India must carefully select a development model for its semiconductor industry. One approach is to support multinational companies (MNCs) that dominate the global semiconductor market. Backing these large semiconductor companies that already control the lion’s share of the sector and boosting them with subsidies will aid manufacturing and make them competitive. It is crucial to note that we are not only subsidising their manufacturing, but also granting them access to our market. This model closely resembles the IT business model of servicing global companies, which has been widely adopted in the past.Changing track The alternative is another time-tested model —The Taiwan model — that focuses on building a global semiconductor industry by empowering local MSMEs and creating job opportunities on a massive scale. This model enabled Taiwanese companies to dominate the semiconductor sector by creating a strong ecosystem supported by thousands of MSMEs and driving job creation. Culturally, India is well-suited for the second model. We possess a unique depth of talent in design that no other country can match. Adopting this model will also ensure that Indian chip companies primarily benefit from government subsidies, fostering local innovation and sustainable economic growth.","cleaned_content":"as the second phase of the semiconductor policy semicon \u003cTWO_\u003e approaches the first phase has already proven successful in raising awareness about market potential workforce scalability and deep engineering talent leading to significant investments and policy reforms in semiconductor manufacturing now the focus should shift to execution which is crucial for success this phase demands a robust strategy effective execution and a passionate commitment to thrive in the next couple of years india should aim to establish at least two semiconductor companies among the global top \u003cONE_TEN\u003e and attain self sufficiency in critical infrastructure across power communications space and defence sectors to realise these ambitious goals india must carefully select a development model for its semiconductor industry one approach is to support multinational companies mncs that dominate the global semiconductor market backing these large semiconductor companies that already control the lion s share of the sector and boosting them with subsidies will aid manufacturing and make them competitive it is crucial to note that we are not only subsidising their manufacturing but also granting them access to our market this model closely resembles the it business model of servicing global companies which has been widely adopted in the past changing track the alternative is another time tested model the taiwan model that focuses on building a global semiconductor industry by empowering local msmes and creating job opportunities on a massive scale this model enabled taiwanese companies to dominate the semiconductor sector by creating a strong ecosystem supported by thousands of msmes and driving job creation culturally india is well suited for the second model we possess a unique depth of talent in design that no other country can match adopting this model will also ensure that indian chip companies primarily benefit from government subsidies fostering local innovation and sustainable economic growth","timestamp":"2024-10-06T06:11:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-07T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
