Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, sued the Securities and Exchange Commission last year in an effort to compel the regulator to act on a petition for rulemaking it filed in 2022.  In that petition, it urged the SEC to provide clarity on the circumstances under which a digital asset is a security and create a new market structure framework that is compatible with cryptocurrencies. The SEC denied Coinbase's petition for new rulemaking in December 2023, with the commission saying it would not propose new rules because it fundamentally disagreed that current regulations are \"unworkable\" for the crypto sector.  Coinbase on Monday asked a federal appeals court to overturn that denial, saying the SEC has made it impossible for the crypto firm to operate and comply with U.S. regulations.","cleaned_content":"coinbase and the u s securities regulator faced off in a federal appeals court in philadelphia on monday as the cryptocurrency exchange presses the agency to create new rules for digital assets coinbase the largest u s crypto exchange sued the securities and exchange commission last year in an effort to compel the regulator to act on a petition for rulemaking it filed in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e in that petition it urged the sec to provide clarity on the circumstances under which a digital asset is a security and create a new market structure framework that is compatible with cryptocurrencies the sec denied coinbases petition for new rulemaking in december \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e with the commission saying it would not propose new rules because it fundamentally disagreed that current regulations are unworkable for the crypto sector coinbase on monday asked a federal appeals court to overturn that denial saying the sec has made it impossible for the crypto firm to operate and comply with u s regulations","timestamp":"2024-09-24T12:56:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-24T12:56:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
