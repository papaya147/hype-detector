My biggest worry is making sure I have supply to do the expansions. It's only the beginning for India moving to the cloud. Around the world, too, it is still the beginning. I don't know what percentage has moved to the cloud, but eight times of that still hasn't,\" said chief executive Safra Catz.","content":"India will play a major role in Oracle’s artificial intelligence infusion journey, chief executive Safra Catz told ET’s Surabhi Agarwal in a virtual interview. Catz, 62, said the country’s rising global profile comes as no surprise given its level of talent and democratic values. However, doing business in India is still challenging sometimes and needs some more simplification, she said. Oracle has seen a resurgence of sorts in the past month with its stock rising almost 20% in September and about 60% year-to-date, after it unveiled a new AI push. Edited excerpts:How are Oracle’s India operations growing?We were one of the early investors in India. Over the years, we've been the largest or the second largest foreign direct investor in India. There is almost no operation that we do anywhere in the world that we don't also do in India, and in many cases, lead in India. Of course, our technical teams are absolute killers. For us, when you join Oracle India, you may, if you want, end up being the head of a major group.We don't look at India as low cost, low quality. We don't believe in that concept. For us, it's part of our global chain that's around the world. Our investments in education in India are absolutely critical, including underprivileged education, because there's always incredible talent. Remember, India is our second largest location. We showed up 32 years ago, when no one was showing up.Are there any fresh investment or expansion plans in India?","cleaned_content":"india will play a major role in oracle s artificial intelligence infusion journey chief executive safra catz told et s surabhi agarwal in a virtual interview catz \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e said the country s rising global profile comes as no surprise given its level of talent and democratic values however doing business in india is still challenging sometimes and needs some more simplification she said oracle has seen a resurgence of sorts in the past month with its stock rising almost \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e in september and about \u003cSIX_TEN_PERCENT\u003e year to date after it unveiled a new ai push edited excerpts how are oracle s india operations growing we were one of the early investors in india over the years weve been the largest or the second largest foreign direct investor in india there is almost no operation that we do anywhere in the world that we dont also do in india and in many cases lead in india of course our technical teams are absolute killers for us when you join oracle india you may if you want end up being the head of a major group we dont look at india as low cost low quality we dont believe in that concept for us its part of our global chain thats around the world our investments in education in india are absolutely critical including underprivileged education because theres always incredible talent remember india is our second largest location we showed up \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e years ago when no one was showing up are there any fresh investment or expansion plans in india","timestamp":"2024-09-24T06:01:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-24T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
