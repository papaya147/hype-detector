This indicates sufficient energy supply from various sources. The average price during May was ₹5.30 per unit, lower than last year's peak period of mid-August to mid-September, which was ₹7.75 per unit. Increased hydro and wind power generation have contributed to this improvement in supply. Even during days of record peak demand, prices remained relatively low on average.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-06-04T00:13:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-06-04T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
