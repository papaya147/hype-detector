The US-based workplace technology company (a global leader in digital print technology and related solutions) has also an $1.3 billion outsourcing deal arrangement with HCLTech, signed in 2019.As per regulatory filed documents with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm’s contractual cash obligations for the year ended December 2023, towards both HCLTech and TCS for 2023 totalled $296 million. But both the Indian vendors could together secure only about $227 million from the US-based company – almost $70 million short of their expected revenue for the same year.Under the expanded agreement, TCS will consolidate Xerox’s technology services to better business outcomes, migrate complex legacy data centers to the Azure public cloud, deploy a cloud-based digital ERP platform to transform business processes and use generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) to help drive sustainable growth, the company said in an exchange filing.Tino Lancellotti, chief information officer, Xerox, said, “This digital transformation initiative is an important enabler for reinventing our operating model to simplify our geographical, offering, and operational footprint while transforming our clients’ experience. We believe TCS is the right partner to deliver such a complex program, given their proven experience both within Xerox and across the industry.”","cleaned_content":"tata consultancy services tcs on friday said it has expanded its strategic partnership with xerox to execute an end to end transformation program the development comes months after xerox revealed its intention in january to reduce its workforce by \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e as part of a reinvention strategy the us based workplace technology company a global leader in digital print technology and related solutions has also an \u003cONE_\u003e billion outsourcing deal arrangement with hcltech signed in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e as per regulatory filed documents with us securities and exchange commission sec the firm s contractual cash obligations for the year ended december \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e towards both hcltech and tcs for \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e totalled \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e million but both the indian vendors could together secure only about \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e million from the us based company almost \u003cSEVEN_TEN\u003e million short of their expected revenue for the same year under the expanded agreement tcs will consolidate xerox s technology services to better business outcomes migrate complex legacy data centers to the azure public cloud deploy a cloud based digital erp platform to transform business processes and use generative artificial intelligence gen ai to help drive sustainable growth the company said in an exchange filing tino lancellotti chief information officer xerox said this digital transformation initiative is an important enabler for reinventing our operating model to simplify our geographical offering and operational footprint while transforming our clients experience we believe tcs is the right partner to deliver such a complex program given their proven experience both within xerox and across the industry","timestamp":"2024-06-21T20:30:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-06-24T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
