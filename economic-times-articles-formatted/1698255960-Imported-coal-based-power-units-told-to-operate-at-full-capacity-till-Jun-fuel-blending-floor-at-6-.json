The move is in response to increasing electricity demand, insufficient domestic fuel supply, and lower hydro generation. The ministry has also extended the current directive for imported coal-based plants, which was set to end in October. Additionally, the requirement for blending imported coal at power generating units has been increased from 4% to meet the rising demand.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2023-10-25T23:16:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2023-10-26T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
