Upon Haque’s promotion to the role of Wipro’s senior vice president (SVP) and localisation as a US employee, he was eligible to receive more than $1 million in equity awards over many years, said the complaint filed in a US court.“Haque began violating his non-competition covenants by working for one of these few prohibited companies, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, on or about August 1, 2023… Haque took every opportunity to hide from Wipro his upcoming employment with Cognizant and gain an unfair advantage over Wipro upon joining,” Wipro said in the complaint reviewed by ET.In the development first reported by TOI, Wipro also alleged that Haque was in possession of confidential information whereby he uploaded and emailed \"seven files\" containing confidential information from his personal Gmail account on or about June 20, 2023, that was flagged off by its IT team on June 22. “Shortly before his resignation was to be effective, Haque surreptitiously uploaded multiple Wipro files and sent them outside Wipro to his personal email account. Haque also misrepresented his intentions to Wipro on multiple occasions, untruthfully telling the company that he was not planning to work at Cognizant,” the complaint said.US-headquartered Cognizant competes directly with Wipro in the digital healthcare services field in which Haque worked for many years while at Wipro.","cleaned_content":"indian it major wipro has filed a complaint against a former senior executive for violation of a non compete clause in his employment contract by joining wipro s direct competitor cognizant before august this year in its complaint wipro said mohd haque who quit in june this year had agreed to certain restrictions on his post employment activities including prohibition of work for a small set of wipro competitors including cognizant for \u003cONE_TEN\u003e months after his employment ended upon haque s promotion to the role of wipro s senior vice president svp and localisation as a us employee he was eligible to receive more than \u003cONE_\u003e million in equity awards over many years said the complaint filed in a us court haque began violating his non competition covenants by working for one of these few prohibited companies cognizant technology solutions corporation on or about august \u003cONE_\u003e \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e haque took every opportunity to hide from wipro his upcoming employment with cognizant and gain an unfair advantage over wipro upon joining wipro said in the complaint reviewed by et in the development first reported by toi wipro also alleged that haque was in possession of confidential information whereby he uploaded and emailed seven files containing confidential information from his personal gmail account on or about june \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e that was flagged off by its it team on june \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e shortly before his resignation was to be effective haque surreptitiously uploaded multiple wipro files and sent them outside wipro to his personal email account haque also misrepresented his intentions to wipro on multiple occasions untruthfully telling the company that he was not planning to work at cognizant the complaint said us headquartered cognizant competes directly with wipro in the digital healthcare services field in which haque worked for many years while at wipro","timestamp":"2023-12-26T06:01:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2023-12-26T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
