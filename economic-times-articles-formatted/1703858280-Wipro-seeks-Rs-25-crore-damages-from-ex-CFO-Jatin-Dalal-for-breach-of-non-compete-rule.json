After a stint of 21 years at Wipro, Dalal resigned as the CFO of Wipro in September and served his last day until November 30, following which he joined global rival Cognizant on December 1.For now, Dalal has submitted a counter application, seeking the Bengaluru civil court to refer the matter to arbitration. Arbitration refers to a process whereby disputed parties agree to resolve their differences through an impartial third party, known as an arbitrator, instead of going to court. Both parties have presented their arguments to the court on November 28.The next hearing has been scheduled for January 3.“As per the agreements, the defendant is liable to recompense the plaintiff the total number of RSU granted multiplied by the share price prevailing on the date of the award or the calculated sum equivalent to the gross remuneration earned by the defendant during the last 12 months of service (as applicable),” according to the contents of the lawsuit, a copy of which has been seen by ET.","cleaned_content":"it major wipro has claimed damages of rs \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e crore along with an annual interest payout at the rate of \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e per annum from september \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e from its former chief financial officer cfo jatin dalal who the company says has violated the non compete clause in his employment contract according to a lawsuit filed in november as part of the non compete agreement one of the clauses barred dalal from joining any other rival company for a period of \u003cONE_TEN\u003e months from the date of his resignation after a stint of \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e years at wipro dalal resigned as the cfo of wipro in september and served his last day until november \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e following which he joined global rival cognizant on december \u003cONE_\u003e for now dalal has submitted a counter application seeking the bengaluru civil court to refer the matter to arbitration arbitration refers to a process whereby disputed parties agree to resolve their differences through an impartial third party known as an arbitrator instead of going to court both parties have presented their arguments to the court on november \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e the next hearing has been scheduled for january \u003cTHREE_\u003e as per the agreements the defendant is liable to recompense the plaintiff the total number of rsu granted multiplied by the share price prevailing on the date of the award or the calculated sum equivalent to the gross remuneration earned by the defendant during the last \u003cONE_TEN\u003e months of service as applicable according to the contents of the lawsuit a copy of which has been seen by et","timestamp":"2023-12-29T19:28:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-01-01T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
