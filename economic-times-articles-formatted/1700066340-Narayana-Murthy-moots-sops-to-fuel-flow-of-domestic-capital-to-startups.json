Edited excerpts: How do you see the Infosys Science Foundationâ€™s journey? It has been a very positive experiment. The number of winners is now sizable at around 90 winners now. A few of them have gone on to win bigger prizes. However, our desire is that we should see a few Fields Medal winners and Nobel laureates who have worked in India. Looking around, I believe that will happen as we move forward.How do you think research and innovation can be pushed within education for better job opportunities? Almost every developed nation has used the power of a few inventions and continuous innovations to improve the lives of citizens.
