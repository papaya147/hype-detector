Banks can now utilize Brickwork Ratings' assessments for calculating risk weights for capital adequacy purposes, subject to certain conditions. These include limitations on new rating mandates for bank loans not exceeding Rs 250 crore, and surveillance requirements for existing ratings, especially for larger facilities. The RBI's decision marks a reevaluation of Brickwork Ratings' status and its role in the banking sector's risk assessment framework.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-07-10T19:47:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-07-11T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
