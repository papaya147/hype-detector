It is six times costlier than the GPT 4o Mini. But what is its best use? Experts weighed in.","content":"OpenAI's latest model o1, dubbed as the strawberry project capable of \"thinking\" and \"reasoning\", is better suited for complex applications like software programming, STEM, legal, disease diagnosis, scientific research etc, executives and experts said. It is six times costlier than the GPT 4o Mini.“It is probably more oriented for developers that are doing math, coding, STEM, academic research versus your general tasks,” said Krish Ramineni, founder of the transcription platform Firelies.ai. “So maybe someone that's building an AI software engineer, this will be more relevant. Or someone that's building an AI physics tutor, it would be more relevant.”“OpenAI is betting on the fact that enterprises will increasingly use AI for reasoning in domains such as quantitative computations and software engineering,” said Arun Chandrasekaran, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.“It is also betting on the fact that higher latency and higher costs would be a fair trade-off for better reasoning performance,” he added.","cleaned_content":"openais latest model o1 dubbed as the strawberry project capable of thinking and reasoning is better suited for complex applications like software programming stem legal disease diagnosis scientific research etc executives and experts said it is six times costlier than the gpt \u003cFOUR_\u003e o mini it is probably more oriented for developers that are doing math coding stem academic research versus your general tasks said krish ramineni founder of the transcription platform firelies ai so maybe someone thats building an ai software engineer this will be more relevant or someone thats building an ai physics tutor it would be more relevant openai is betting on the fact that enterprises will increasingly use ai for reasoning in domains such as quantitative computations and software engineering said arun chandrasekaran distinguished vp analyst gartner it is also betting on the fact that higher latency and higher costs would be a fair trade off for better reasoning performance he added","timestamp":"2024-09-16T06:00:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-16T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
