While sales of two-wheelers went up by 13.25% to 1,439,523 units in the month under consideration, those of three-wheelers rose 23.88% to 94,918 units. “The 2W market's 13% YoY growth was driven by the rural sector, premium model demand, and strong entry-level segment performance, with broader product availability and compelling offers enhancing product acceptance. Factors like favourable marriage dates and improved economic conditions also contributed to this positive growth”, Singhania informed.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-03-07T17:46:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-03-08T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
