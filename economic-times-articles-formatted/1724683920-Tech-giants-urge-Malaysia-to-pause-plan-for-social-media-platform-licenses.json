In July, Malaysia's communications regulator said social media platforms with more than eight million users in the country would be required to apply for a license from this month as part of a drive to combat cybercrime.  Legal action could be taken against the platforms if they failed to do so by Jan. 1, 2025, the regulator said.  In an open letter dated Friday and addressed to Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) - whose members also include Apple Inc, Amazon and Grab - said the proposed licensing regime was \"unworkable\" for the industry and could stifle innovation by placing undue burdens on businesses.  The group said there had been no formal public consultations on the plan, leading to industry uncertainty regarding the scope of obligations to be imposed on social media platforms.
