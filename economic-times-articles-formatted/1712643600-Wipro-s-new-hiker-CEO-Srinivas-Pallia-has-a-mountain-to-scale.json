ET has seen a copy of the email.Meanwhile, in a four-page emailed letter to employees, Delaporte said his task — bringing about a deep structural transformation at India’s fourth-largest IT services company — has been accomplished. “I'm handing this over to my successor, who will drive excellence on the back of this transformation, and move towards execution of all the investments we’ve made,” he said, adding that Pallia, who was one of his “strongest leaders in the executive team” and who knows Wipro better than most others, was the “natural choice” for the top job.During his four-year stint, the firm has reported 35% revenue growth and a 25% increase in profit, apart from making 12 acquisitions, Delaporte wrote in the email, which has also been seen by ET. “Wipro's stock price has grown 2.5x in value during this time… Now with the foundational elements of the transformation in place, my main goal is complete,” he wrote.","cleaned_content":"wipro s new chief executive srinivas pallia said his immediate focus will be on supporting clients and stressed on embracing bold ideas and taking calculated risks as the company seeks to shrug off the tag of an underperformer in india s \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e billion it services sector wipro named the \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e year old an avid hiker who has spent \u003cTHREE_TEN\u003e years in the bengaluru headquartered company to the top job on saturday after his predecessor frenchman thierry delaporte resigned in a surprise development with \u003cONE_TEN\u003e months of his tenure remaining i will be a relentless advocate urging us to focus on execution embrace bold ideas and take calculated risks to propel us forward he said in his first email to employees after assuming the role on sunday et has seen a copy of the email meanwhile in a four page emailed letter to employees delaporte said his task bringing about a deep structural transformation at india s fourth largest it services company has been accomplished im handing this over to my successor who will drive excellence on the back of this transformation and move towards execution of all the investments we ve made he said adding that pallia who was one of his strongest leaders in the executive team and who knows wipro better than most others was the natural choice for the top job during his four year stint the firm has reported \u003cTHREE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e revenue growth and a \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e increase in profit apart from making \u003cONE_TEN\u003e acquisitions delaporte wrote in the email which has also been seen by et wipros stock price has grown \u003cTWO_\u003e x in value during this time now with the foundational elements of the transformation in place my main goal is complete he wrote","timestamp":"2024-04-09T11:50:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-04-09T11:50:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
