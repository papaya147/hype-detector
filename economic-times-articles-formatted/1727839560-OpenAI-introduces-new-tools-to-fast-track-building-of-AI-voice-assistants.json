The enhancements, aimed at maintaining competitiveness with tech giants like Google, are expected to significantly boost OpenAI's revenue.","content":"OpenAI unveiled a host of new tools on Tuesday that would make it easier for developers to build applications based on its artificial intelligence technology, as the ChatGPT maker wrestles with tech giants to keep up in the generative AI race. The Microsoft-backed startup said a new real-time tool, rolling out immediately for testing, would allow developers to create AI voice applications using a single set of instructions. The process earlier required developers to go through at least three steps: first transcribing audio, then running the generated-text model to come up with an answer to the query and finally using a separate text-to-speech model. A large chunk of OpenAI's revenue comes from businesses that use its services to build their own AI applications, making the rollout of advanced capabilities a key selling point. Competition has also been heating up as technology giants, including Google-parent Alphabet, integrate AI models capable of crunching different forms of information such as video, audio and text across their businesses.","cleaned_content":"openai unveiled a host of new tools on tuesday that would make it easier for developers to build applications based on its artificial intelligence technology as the chatgpt maker wrestles with tech giants to keep up in the generative ai race the microsoft backed startup said a new real time tool rolling out immediately for testing would allow developers to create ai voice applications using a single set of instructions the process earlier required developers to go through at least three steps first transcribing audio then running the generated text model to come up with an answer to the query and finally using a separate text to speech model a large chunk of openais revenue comes from businesses that use its services to build their own ai applications making the rollout of advanced capabilities a key selling point competition has also been heating up as technology giants including google parent alphabet integrate ai models capable of crunching different forms of information such as video audio and text across their businesses","timestamp":"2024-10-02T08:56:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-10-03T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
