It is calculated by dividing the total amount of power used by a data centre by the amount of power used by its computing equipment. A lower PUE ratio indicates better energy efficiency.As per the new clause introduced by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) in a corrigendum to the bid issued in the last week of September, a bidder must confirm that the PUE for the data centres from which AI services on cloud would be delivered is not more than 1.35.
