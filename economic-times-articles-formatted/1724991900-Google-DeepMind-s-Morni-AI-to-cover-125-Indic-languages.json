But in our work, we are targeting over 100 Indian languages, because we find that there are 60 Indian languages which have over a billion speakers and over 125 languages that have over a lakh speakers each,” said Manish Gupta, director at Google DeepMind, Google India. He was speaking at the Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai on Thursday.According to him, 73 of these 125 languages had zero corpus of digital data available. Even for a language like Hindi, which is now spoken by close to 10% of the world's population, the share of text on the internet is 0.1%.Google’s research lab overcame the challenge of sourcing data for these languages by launching a project, Vaani — a collaboration among Google, Indian Institute of Science and ARTPARK (Artificial Intelligence \u0026 Robotics Technology Park).The project has completed its first phase to create an open-source database of over 14,000 hours of speech data in 58 languages, collected from 80,000 speakers in 80 districts, Gupta said.","cleaned_content":"google deepmind s india unit is working on an indic language artificial intelligence project called morni multimodal representation for india with an aim to cover \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e indian languages and dialects so india has \u003cTWO_TEN\u003e scheduled languages which are viewed as official languages but in our work we are targeting over \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e indian languages because we find that there are \u003cSIX_TEN\u003e indian languages which have over a billion speakers and over \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e languages that have over a lakh speakers each said manish gupta director at google deepmind google india he was speaking at the global fintech fest in mumbai on thursday according to him \u003cSEVEN_TEN\u003e of these \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e languages had zero corpus of digital data available even for a language like hindi which is now spoken by close to \u003cONE_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of the worlds population the share of text on the internet is \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e google s research lab overcame the challenge of sourcing data for these languages by launching a project vaani a collaboration among google indian institute of science and artpark artificial intelligence robotics technology park the project has completed its first phase to create an open source database of over \u003cONE_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e hours of speech data in \u003cFIVE_TEN\u003e languages collected from \u003cEIGHT_TEN_THOUSAND\u003e speakers in \u003cEIGHT_TEN\u003e districts gupta said","timestamp":"2024-08-30T09:55:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-08-30T09:55:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
