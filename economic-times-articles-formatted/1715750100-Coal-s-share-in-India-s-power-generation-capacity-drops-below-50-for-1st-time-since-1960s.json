Renewable energy accounted for 71.5 percent of the 13,669 MW power generation capacity added by India in Q1 2024. This trend is well ahead of India's target of achieving 50% cumulative power generation capacity from non-fossil fuel-based sources by 2030. The decline in coal's share mirrors a global trend, with demand for coal in G7 countries hitting record lows in 2023. G7 countries pledged to phase out all unabated coal power generation by 2035.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-05-15T10:45:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-05-15T10:45:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
