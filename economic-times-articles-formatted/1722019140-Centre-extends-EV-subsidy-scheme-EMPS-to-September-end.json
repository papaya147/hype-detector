The scheme's budget was also increased to Rs 778 crore, from the initial Rs 500 crore. EMPS offers subsidies up to Rs 10,000 for electric two-wheelers and Rs 50,000 for electric three-wheelers, aimed at promoting clean energy vehicles following the FAME scheme's lapse. Moreover, the target numbers for EV sales were raised to 5.61 lakh from 3.72 lakh vehicles initially, with companies like Hero Motocorp and Bajaj among the beneficiaries. The EMPS mandates stricter localization compliance, phasing out the previous scheme's phased manufacturing programme.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2024-07-27T00:09:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-07-29T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
