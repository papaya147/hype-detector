This comes after stocks at domestic coal-based plants decreased rapidly in the first half of October. However, the trend has now reversed, with daily coal supply exceeding consumption and a trend of stock accumulation. Production has also increased after a rainy spell in early October. As of October 21, total coal stock was 71.35 million tonnes, compared to 60.44 million tonnes last year.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2023-10-23T23:03:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2023-10-24T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
