OpenAI is predicting its revenue will skyrocket to $11.6 billion next year from an estimated $3.7 billion in 2024, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Losses are expected to be as much as $5 billion this year, depending largely on their spending for computing power that could change, one of the sources added. The current funding round, which comes in the form of convertible debt, is expected to close by the end of next week and could value OpenAI at $150 billion, cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world. That valuation depends on pulling off a complicated restructuring to remove the control of its non-profit board and also remove cap on investment return to investors, a plan first reported by Reuters. There is no specific timeline when the conversion could be completed. Thrive Capital, which also led OpenAI's previous funding round, is offering $1.2 billion from a combination of its own fund and a special purpose vehicle for smaller investors. Other investors on the new round include Microsoft, Apple , Nvidia and Khosla Ventures.","cleaned_content":"thrive capital is investing more than \u003cONE_\u003e billion of openais current \u003cSIX_\u003e billion fundraising round and it has a sweetener no other investors are getting the potential to invest another \u003cONE_\u003e billion next year at the same valuation if the ai firm hits a revenue goal people familiar with the matter said on friday openai is predicting its revenue will skyrocket to \u003cONE_TEN\u003e billion next year from an estimated \u003cTHREE_\u003e billion in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e the sources said speaking on condition of anonymity losses are expected to be as much as \u003cFIVE_\u003e billion this year depending largely on their spending for computing power that could change one of the sources added the current funding round which comes in the form of convertible debt is expected to close by the end of next week and could value openai at \u003cONE_HUNDRED\u003e billion cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world that valuation depends on pulling off a complicated restructuring to remove the control of its non profit board and also remove cap on investment return to investors a plan first reported by reuters there is no specific timeline when the conversion could be completed thrive capital which also led openais previous funding round is offering \u003cONE_\u003e billion from a combination of its own fund and a special purpose vehicle for smaller investors other investors on the new round include microsoft apple nvidia and khosla ventures","timestamp":"2024-09-28T12:27:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-30T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
