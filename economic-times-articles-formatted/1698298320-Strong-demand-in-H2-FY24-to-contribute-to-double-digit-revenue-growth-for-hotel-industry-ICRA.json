This growth will be driven by domestic leisure travel, demand from meetings and conferences, business travel, and an increase in foreign tourist arrivals. ICRA estimates that premium hotel occupancy will reach 70-72% in 2024, with average room rates expected to be around Rs 6,000-6,200. Additionally, the industry has benefited from events like the G20 summit and the ICC World Cup 2023.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2023-10-26T11:02:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2023-10-26T11:02:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
