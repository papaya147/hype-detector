If I wear my Brookfield hat, we can invest in any type of hospitality play. We can invest in select service, we can invest in mid scale, we can invest in upper upscale besides luxury. We can invest in resorts, we can invest in city hotels, services, and we are evaluating all of these concepts on a regular basis. As far as the Leela business is concerned, it's a real play on luxury, and that will remain the core of that business,\" Gupta said.","content":"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)","cleaned_content":"you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel","timestamp":"2023-09-08T19:25:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2023-09-11T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
