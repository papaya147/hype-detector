CEO Aiman Ezzat highlighted challenges in the automotive, aerospace, and financial sectors affecting growth.","content":"French IT consulting group Capgemini forecast a surprise fall in annual revenue on Friday, citing persistent weakness in its North American market. The Paris-based group said it now expects its organic sales to fall between 0.5% and 1.5% in 2024, compared with the 0-3% rise previously forecast. \"The slope of recovery in the second half will be affected by the recent deterioration of the outlook in the automotive and aerospace sectors and the slower recovery in financial services,\" CEO Aiman Ezzat said in a statement. The company posted a 5.4% year-on-year decline in revenue from the North America region in the first half of the year, slower than the 7.1% fall seen in the first three months of 2024. The market was the second biggest for the group, accounting for 28% of its revenue in the first half of the year. It was a drag on Capgemini's results last year as well, amid a tech sector downturn.","cleaned_content":"french it consulting group capgemini forecast a surprise fall in annual revenue on friday citing persistent weakness in its north american market the paris based group said it now expects its organic sales to fall between \u003cZERO_PERCENT\u003e and \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e in \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e compared with the \u003cZERO_\u003e \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e rise previously forecast the slope of recovery in the second half will be affected by the recent deterioration of the outlook in the automotive and aerospace sectors and the slower recovery in financial services ceo aiman ezzat said in a statement the company posted a \u003cFIVE_PERCENT\u003e year on year decline in revenue from the north america region in the first half of the year slower than the \u003cSEVEN_PERCENT\u003e fall seen in the first three months of \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e the market was the second biggest for the group accounting for \u003cTWO_TEN_PERCENT\u003e of its revenue in the first half of the year it was a drag on capgeminis results last year as well amid a tech sector downturn","timestamp":"2024-07-26T11:45:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-07-26T11:45:00+05:30","off_market_hours":false}
