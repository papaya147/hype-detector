U.S. power generation capacity through the end of the decade could rise by about 2.4% to 2.7%, according to an analysis of the most recent available U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, from late 2022. Data center power use is expected to more than double by 2030 to consume about 9% of all the country's electricity. Tech companies are scrambling to meet a surge in energy demand from data centers to power generative AI. But tapping the nuclear system involves regulatory hurdles, possible supply-chain snags, sometimes stiff local opposition and scrutiny from water authorities concerned about healthy reservoirs.  In March, 1979, Three Mile Island made global headlines with a partial meltdown at its Unit 2 reactor. The reopening plan covers the Unit 1 reactor at the Pennsylvania plant, which operated safely for decades before being closed five years ago.  The $1.6-billion plan would restart Unit 1 by 2028 to offset Microsoft's data-center power consumption in the region. It is the latest deal between a technology company and a nuclear-power provider. In March, Talen Energy agreed to sell a data center to Amazon.com next to Talen's nuclear plant, which operates elsewhere in Pennsylvania.","cleaned_content":"constellation energy and microsoft plan to restart the three mile island nuclear plant hoping they have scored a quick source of enough climate friendly energy to power rapidly expanding data centers for artificial intelligence ai u s power generation capacity through the end of the decade could rise by about \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cTWO_PERCENT\u003e according to an analysis of the most recent available u s energy information administration eia data from late \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e data center power use is expected to more than double by \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e to consume about \u003cNINE_PERCENT\u003e of all the countrys electricity tech companies are scrambling to meet a surge in energy demand from data centers to power generative ai but tapping the nuclear system involves regulatory hurdles possible supply chain snags sometimes stiff local opposition and scrutiny from water authorities concerned about healthy reservoirs in march \u003cONE_THOUSAND\u003e three mile island made global headlines with a partial meltdown at its unit \u003cTWO_\u003e reactor the reopening plan covers the unit \u003cONE_\u003e reactor at the pennsylvania plant which operated safely for decades before being closed five years ago the \u003cONE_\u003e billion plan would restart unit \u003cONE_\u003e by \u003cTWO_THOUSAND\u003e to offset microsofts data center power consumption in the region it is the latest deal between a technology company and a nuclear power provider in march talen energy agreed to sell a data center to amazon com next to talens nuclear plant which operates elsewhere in pennsylvania","timestamp":"2024-09-24T19:28:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-09-25T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
