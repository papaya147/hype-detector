The latest version of the F77 is called the Mach 2.Given the higher pricing of the vehicle, starting above Rs 3 lakhs in India, Ultraviolette has not received any of the benefits under the Production Linked Incentives (PLI) or the Faster Adoption \u0026 Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) subsidies. However, it is set to receive some benefits around exports as it starts to expand into EU markets later this year.“We have seen a lot of government initiatives around EVs, but they are mostly towards mass adoption, and we understand the need for that, but unless there are a couple of firms in the ecosystem that are constantly pushing the boundaries of tech, the baseline does not get higher,” cofounder and chief executive Narayan Subramaniam told ET.A higher baseline for tech quality would also spur increased export of Indian technology and products abroad, said cofounder and chief technology officer Niraj Rajmohan. Barriers from regulations in western markets are secondary to the high customer demand for quality, and that is where Indian products have struggled to convince such markets, he opined.","cleaned_content":"pitching for more government benefits for firms working on high tech and premium products the cofounders of electric bike maker ultraviolette said such support could spur exports from india and help push up the technology benchmark of the local electric vehicle ecosystem the firm which launched the latest version of its flagship bike f77 on wednesday is set to begin deliveries of its bikes in european union eu markets like turkey spain and germany from the second half of this year the latest version of the f77 is called the mach \u003cTWO_\u003e given the higher pricing of the vehicle starting above rs \u003cTHREE_\u003e lakhs in india ultraviolette has not received any of the benefits under the production linked incentives pli or the faster adoption manufacturing of electric vehicles fame subsidies however it is set to receive some benefits around exports as it starts to expand into eu markets later this year we have seen a lot of government initiatives around evs but they are mostly towards mass adoption and we understand the need for that but unless there are a couple of firms in the ecosystem that are constantly pushing the boundaries of tech the baseline does not get higher cofounder and chief executive narayan subramaniam told et a higher baseline for tech quality would also spur increased export of indian technology and products abroad said cofounder and chief technology officer niraj rajmohan barriers from regulations in western markets are secondary to the high customer demand for quality and that is where indian products have struggled to convince such markets he opined","timestamp":"2024-04-24T19:46:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-04-25T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
