Accordingly, for most of our coverage companies, we see YoY revenue growth to start recovering from 4QFY24,” BNP Paribas analyst Kumar Rakesh said in a report. “That said, we note that some firms continue to see the impact of project ramp-downs… We think FY25 guidance will be a critical near-term catalyst, along with US macro-economic indicators in the coming months.”For the likes of TCS, Infosys, HCLTech and Wipro, it expects 4QFY24 constant currency (CC) organic revenue growth at -1% to +1%, while mid- and small-caps could report 1-3% QoQ (quarter on quarter) USD organic revenue growth.While the industry’s struggle with constrained discretionary demand is likely to continue over the next 3-4 months, rising PMIs, benign inflation prints and a start to the rate easing cycle should allow for a continuation of the Goldilocks phase, BNP Paribas said.","cleaned_content":"hcltech and tata consultancy services tcs will likely pull ahead of their top tier software rivals as the \u003cTWO_HUNDRED\u003e billion indian outsourcing industry starts publishing next week the fourth quarter earnings which investors will comb for commentary on business outlook in fy25 that many expect would see higher discretionary expenses by us and european companies the start to the us rate easing cycle later this year should aid it budgets in the primary revenue generating market for indian technology while strong deal wins in recent quarters would translate into revenue growth acceleration in fy25 recovery of furloughs and ramp up of recently won large deals should aid revenue growth accordingly for most of our coverage companies we see yoy revenue growth to start recovering from \u003cFOUR_\u003e qfy24 bnp paribas analyst kumar rakesh said in a report that said we note that some firms continue to see the impact of project ramp downs we think fy25 guidance will be a critical near term catalyst along with us macro economic indicators in the coming months for the likes of tcs infosys hcltech and wipro it expects \u003cFOUR_\u003e qfy24 constant currency cc organic revenue growth at \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e to \u003cONE_PERCENT\u003e while mid and small caps could report \u003cONE_\u003e \u003cTHREE_PERCENT\u003e qoq quarter on quarter usd organic revenue growth while the industry s struggle with constrained discretionary demand is likely to continue over the next \u003cTHREE_\u003e \u003cFOUR_\u003e months rising pmis benign inflation prints and a start to the rate easing cycle should allow for a continuation of the goldilocks phase bnp paribas said","timestamp":"2024-04-03T06:00:00+05:30","market_timestamp":"2024-04-03T09:15:00+05:30","off_market_hours":true}
