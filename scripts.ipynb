or london s heathrow which ferried almost <FIVE_TEN> million and <SEVEN_TEN> million passengers last year respectively what s more london has six major airports while new york city has three signaling

flying from the new facility transit timethe airport is being designed to reduce the transit time to catch connecting flights ideally within <SEVEN_TEN> minutes in line with international norms said

lift and shift he said adani airport which plans to list some time before <TWO_THOUSAND> and already runs seven other facilities won t force any airlines to shut down from the older mumbai airport and move to navi mumbai because that will be discriminatory right he said a feb <ONE_TEN> report from jefferies estimated that more than half of adani airport s forecast <ONE_> billion revenue in <TWO_THOUSAND> will come from the two mumbai facilities kawn on the other hand sees adani s ownership of the two airports as a boon considering there ll be no destructive competition the navi mumbai airport will also accentuate another major dilemma for local policymakers whether to further open india s skies the south asia nation is currently avoiding expanding the flying rights of foreign carriers to allow its own airlines some of them financially vulnerable to grow on international routes but that policy choice risks hampering its own ambitions to become a global transit hub tightrope
